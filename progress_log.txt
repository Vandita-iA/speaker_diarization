 SPEAKER_01: So Mr. Duncan, I'm so sorry to interrupt you.  Well, we actually are not here to sell you anything.  The reason actually I was calling you is because Amazon actually has come up with an exciting  opportunity for small and medium-sized businesses like yours to explore generative AI solutions.  So which is actually, AWS is offering a free consultation now for that could help you leverage  cutting edge AI technology to grow your business.  So in this, you will learn how large language models and generative AI can benefit your  specific business needs.  And that's why AWS is offering a free one-hour consultation with AI expert to help you.  So is that something that you'd be interested in so that you would like us to arrange this?
 SPEAKER_00: No, I don't think so.  We're using LLMs to write articles, help us write articles, technical papers, review technical  papers and that sort of thing.  But I think we're happy with what we're getting with open AI for that service.  So now it's not for us, I don't think.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, thank you so much, Ben.  Is that all right if we can share all the information, additional information via email to you?  I'm sorry?  We can have a look at it as we...  Is that okay if we can share this information regarding this AI and artificial intelligence  on your email and you can have a look at it as we can use?
 SPEAKER_00: No, we can search it out.  So I appreciate it.  Thank you very much.
 SPEAKER_01: No worries.  Thank you, Mr. Duncan.  You have a great day.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, have a good day.  Yeah, you too.  All right, bye-bye.

 SPEAKER_00: Am I?  This is Jason.  I'm calling on behalf of AWS.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Good.  How are you?
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Great.  I'm doing it too.  Thank you very much for asking.  I believe I'm talking to Amar with the other team. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: We call for project manager BI and e-commerce with the company vertical supply.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's correct.
 SPEAKER_00: Lovely.  So, Ms. Weecoff, the reason actually I was calling is because our Amazon Web Services,  AWS has come up with a consultation call.  Well, I believe that your business is already using AWS, right?  Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, correct.
 SPEAKER_00: Lovely.  So, this opportunity, this exciting opportunity is only for the businesses who are already  using AWS services, which is for small and medium-sized businesses like yours to explore  generative AI solutions.  So, AWS services is actually wanted to share a free consultation offer that could help  you leverage cutting-edge technology, AI technology to grow your business.  So, would you be interested in learning how large language models and generative AI can  benefit your specific businesses, which offers a free one-hour consultation with AI experts  to help you?
 SPEAKER_01: I wouldn't actually.  That part of the business is not really my domain.  We have specialists who work on the Amazon side, and anything that would require budget  is actually up to my supervisor.  I'm not working today, so I'm not able to put you in touch with them.  But, yeah, that wouldn't be my area of expertise.
 SPEAKER_00: That's absolutely fine, Ms. Vickoff.  So, is that all right if we can share the information on your email so that you can have a look at  it as per your convenience, and if you find anything beneficial, you can always get back  to us if that is okay?
 SPEAKER_01: I really think you should save yourself the time, unfortunately, because we really are  bringing in new technology at this point in the year, potentially for next year, but  this isn't something that, again, I would be able to have any influence over.  So, I appreciate your call, but no, thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: No worries, Ms. Vickoff.  No worries.  Thank you.  Have a lovely day there.  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_01: You too.  Bye-bye.

 SPEAKER_01: I'm calling on behalf of AWS.  The reason I was calling is because we have noticed that your business is actually using  Amazon Web Services already.  I was calling to discuss an exciting opportunity for small and medium-sized businesses like  yours to explore generative AI solutions.  AWS is actually sharing a free consultation offer that could help you leverage cutting-edge  AI technology to grow your business.  Ms. Dahlinshire, is it okay if you would be interested in learning how large language  models and generative AI can benefit your business-specific business needs, which offer a free  one-hour consultation with AI experts to help you?
 SPEAKER_00: No, thank you.
 SPEAKER_01: If not for a consultation, is that all right if AWS can share the information on your email  so that you can have a look at it as per your convenience and if you find anything beneficial,  you can get back to us?
 SPEAKER_00: No, thank you.
 SPEAKER_01: No.  All right.  No worries.  Any specific reason?
 SPEAKER_00: I don't know if it's not something you'd be interested in, but thank you.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello?
 SPEAKER_00: Hi there, I'm speaking with Irvin, Irvin Batwal.  Yes, yeah.  Irvin, my name is Akhil, Akhil Sharma.  I'm calling on behalf of AWS, how are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Good, good.
 SPEAKER_00: Great.  Irvin, the reason of my call is,  I see that your company is currently using AWS services  for quite a long time.  And we wanted to share a limited time offer  that would help you to leverage AI technology  to grow your business.  So I currently...
 SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think,  no, I don't think, at least I'm not involved  in that part of the business.  So I don't have any possibility to use AWS or not.
 SPEAKER_00: No, I agree, Irvin.  I see that you are currently working  as a senior director with Intel in your right?  Yeah, go ahead.  Right, so do you take care of like sales, marketing,  finance or operations?
 SPEAKER_01: That's a pretty wide area, what are you looking for?
 SPEAKER_00: So basically AI, as you are at that position,  so you know AI is not just a department specific,  you can use it in any department of the business.  So that is the reason I'm calling  and it is nothing to do with technology,  technical knowledge about it or decision-making.  It's more about to know how you can implement AI technology  to your line of business  and then be successful in your line of business.  So if you would be interested,  we would like to share an email with you  with all the information and get you registered  or participant to a four-week program  wherein you will learn how you can utilize AI  in your line of business or the areas which you look at it.  So that's the only motive of the call.
 SPEAKER_01: No, sorry, I'm in the, I got other stuff to do right now,  so I'm not in time to invest time in that area.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, no problem, Irvin.  Thank you for your time.  You have a great day.
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: Sure, thank you.  Thank you. Unknown Speaker: Thank you.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello, this is David.
 SPEAKER_00: Do you have a meeting with David, please?  Hi, David. My name is Hina, calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services. How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_00: Yes.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay. What's your for?
 SPEAKER_00: Okay. So, David, actually we have noticed that your business has been using Amazon Web Services.  And we just wanted to share a limited time offer that could help you leverage AI technology to grow your business.  And if you're just interested in learning.
 SPEAKER_01: No, I'm not interested. We have a perfectly good marketing program and we're not looking for anything new at this time.  If you wanted to.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm not looking for any change. It is just a limited time offer which will benefit.
 SPEAKER_01: I don't really deal with that stuff. I'm not directly involved in marketing anymore. I used to be. I'm semi retired now.  And I'm doing all the construction projects for the company.  So, you'd have to reach out to our corporate office and see if they can put you in touch with our IT director or somebody that deals directly with our marketing.
 SPEAKER_00: So, you're no longer working with the company?
 SPEAKER_01: I do. It's our family's business.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: So, I'm still involved but I don't deal with marketing anymore.  I deal, as I said, with new construction. We're opening new locations all the time. So, I really don't deal with the marketing side.  But thank you so much. Have a great day.
 SPEAKER_00: You too. Bye.

In addition to your name and email and your phone number, MissionCloud will be provided  with the project title, project description, project revenue estimates to AWS,  and the project timeline.  Okay.  So, providing MissionCloud with your information may involve transferring into another country,  AWS Handbook CIR, information as described in AWS Privacy Notice.  For any questions about how MissionCloud will handle your information,  please contact MissionCloud directly to refer to your privacy policy. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'll go ahead and cancel out of that then.  I don't want somebody from another country to contact me at the time,  especially when it comes to my work, my work plan.
 SPEAKER_00: No one will contact you from another country, Michael.  You just said that.  I just said, it's a terms and condition that providing MissionCloud with your information  may involve transferring into another country.  AWS handles your information as described in AWS Privacy Notice.  For any question about how MissionCloud will handle your information,  please contact MissionCloud directly to refer to its privacy policy.  So, it's just like a disclaimer, basically, because we are calling from AWS  and on behalf of AWS, so we don't want any misconception about it.
 SPEAKER_01: Right.  I don't want you talking to somebody outside of the United States about business that I do here,  because some of it is fencing, and I can't just discuss that with people in general.  So, I'd have to opt out at this time.  Thank you very much.
 SPEAKER_00: No problem, Michael.  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello, I'm speaking with James Fyden.
 SPEAKER_01: Who is this?
 SPEAKER_00: My name is Hina, calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_01: On who?
 SPEAKER_00: That's Amazon Web Services.  I said Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_01: Amazon Web Services?
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, Web Services, W-E-B, Amazon Web Services. Unknown Speaker: Oh, well.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.
 SPEAKER_01: How can I help you?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so James, actually we have noticed that you are an AWS customer and we have a limited time offer that could be valuable for your business.  So we are just offering a free migration and licensing optimization assessment that has helped businesses like yours reduce their total cost of ownership by up to 56% and migrate 34% faster to the AWS cloud.  And this will be undertaken by TD Cinex and AWS Premier Partner.  So is your company still running workloads on costly on-premises servers?
 SPEAKER_01: I have no idea, but that goes without building a department or anything like that.  I'm just a general manager over here.  So we have to go through a little bit of a department, not through me.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you're not involved in this?
 SPEAKER_01: I am involved in a lot of that stuff, but it goes through our corporate facility before it comes to me first.  So you reach out to the wrong person first.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: An assessment, what you can do is, so if you'd be interested in taking advantage of this assessment to optimize your IT infrastructure.
 SPEAKER_01: I'm not because I don't deal with it.  They find out their own sources and then they come back with me with that.  And then I decide which I'm going to go through first.  It costs everybody else's best and it comes to my desk.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, no problem.
 SPEAKER_01: All right, thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: That is correct. What is your calling party to?
 SPEAKER_00: Alright, wonderful. So well, I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services to discuss an exciting opportunity for small and medium-sized businesses like yours to explore generative AI.  And we have noticed your company have been using Amazon Web Services. Would that be correct, right?
 SPEAKER_01: I don't handle the IT side of our company.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, this is not only for IT. This is a generative AI in relation to artificial. So have you ever planned or have you ever thought to implement AI into your operation?
 SPEAKER_01: It would have to be regulated by the state of Illinois. It would have to be approved for use in the gaming industry.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so well, we want to share all the information as well. And just want to let you know that we are offering a free one-hour consultation with AI experts to help you.  And you can also learn how large language models and generative AI can benefit your specific needs.  So would that be fine if we go ahead and share a consultation offer with you and to help you leverage getting AI technology to grow your businesses?
 SPEAKER_01: As I said, we are highly regulated by the state of Illinois and the federal government. And if it's not approved for use in casino gaming, I cannot approve any kind of appointments or anything.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: So all right, I too completely understand. But have you ever thought to implement in your operations AI project?  No.  Not at all.  All right, no problem then. Anyway, thank you so much for your time, Ellen. It was a pleasure speaking with you.  Enjoy it.
 SPEAKER_01: Likewise. Thank you.

Great.  So just to let you know that I'm calling you to discuss an  opportunity that could help your business significantly reduce  cost and optimize your IT infrastructure.  And we are offering a free migration and licensing optimization  assessment that has helped businesses like you to reduce  costs of ownership by up to 56% and migrate 34% faster to AWS  Cloud.  So are you currently still using or you're running the  workloads on costly on-premises server?

 SPEAKER_01: So we are not changing anything, Anil.  We are not calling you to change anything in your current  setup.  We just want to take an assessment so we can help you to show  how you can save some costs by doing the migration.  That's it.  It's a free assessment from AWS.
 SPEAKER_00: I am not looking for that.  So no, thank you at this point.  Okay, Anil, no problem.  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00: How are you doing today?  I'm doing very well.
 SPEAKER_01: What can I help you with?  Sounds wonderful.  Steve, the reason I contacted you today since I can see that you are the director for marketing  for BSB design.  We wanted to discuss an opportunity that could help your organization significantly reduce  cost and optimize your IT infrastructure.  As we have noticed, you are an AWS customer and we have a limited time offer that could  be valuable for your business.  Today, what we are doing is we are offering you a free migration and licensing optimization  assessment that has helped business like yours reduce their total cost of ownership by up  to 56% and migrate 34% faster to the AWS cloud.  This will be undertaken by TD, Cinex and AWS Premier partners.  I'm sure your company is still running workloads on costly on-premises servers, right?
 SPEAKER_00: Most of what you are speaking is not in my area.  We have an IT department that handles everything you are talking about.  I have nothing to do with that.
 SPEAKER_01: I completely understand, Steve, that you being into marketing, you must be not looking into  this part of department.  Have you ever thought about implementing such things in marketing departments?  Have you ever thought about this?
 SPEAKER_00: No, I have not.  I don't think I'm interested at all.  I sure appreciate your call and I wish you good luck.
 SPEAKER_01: Thanks very much.  That is the reason, Steve.  That is the reason, Steve.

Transcript: Speaker SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hello. Unknown Speaker: Hello.
 SPEAKER_01: Hello.  Hello, I'm asking to Nabil.  Nabil Menmi.  Yep.  Hi, Nabil.  This is Freyash.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?  Good, how are you?  I'm doing great.  Thanks for asking.  Well, Nabil, I believe you are the director of national sales at Maslow Paper Mills.  Marked out, yep.  Okay, great, great.  Well, the reason I wanted to reach out to you, like I said, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  And we believe that I want to discuss an opportunity that could help your business significantly reduce costs and optimize your IT infrastructure.  Now, we noticed that you are an AWS customer and we have a limited time offer that could be valuable for your business.  So, basically, we are offering a free migration and licensing optimization assessment that helps businesses like yours to reduce their total cost of ownership by up to 56% and migrate 34% faster to the AWS cloud.  Now, this would be taken under, you know, this would be undertaken by TV Cinex and AWS Premier Partners.  Your company is still running workloads on costly on-premises services, right?
 SPEAKER_00: So, I'm not involved in the IT side of things.  There's a gentleman by the name of Mark Williams.  I can give you his email address if you'd like.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, well, my intention is not to, you know, specifically reach out to the IT people.  I believe you are the director of national sales, right?
 SPEAKER_00: The only reason I want to reach out to you.  To do with any of this.  So, I'm not the person to talk to about this, Mark, would be.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay.  In that case, can you help me with the email address of the person with the IT?
 SPEAKER_00: Yep, it's Mark.  Dot Williams.  So, M-A-R-K dot Williams W-I-L-L-I-A-M-S.  At MarkHallPaper.com.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay.  Great.  So, that would be Mark Williams at MarkHallPaper.com, right?  Yep, yep.  Okay, is he like an IT manager or director?  How do we work?
 SPEAKER_00: He runs our entire IT for the company.  Okay, like a CTO?  I'm director of...  Oh, more of a director.  Yeah, yeah.  We don't have a CTO.  So, he reports directly into our, I think, our CFO.
 SPEAKER_01: So, okay, no worries.  In that case, I will make note of it.  Okay.  Before I let you go, I just wanted to understand, since you are the director of national sales,  and my intention, like I said previously, is not to share or sell or something like that.  The only reason I want to reach out to you to educate you about the AI technology and how you can integrate the process of your sales and use it for your benefit.  So, I just want to understand, like, are you interested in learning how large language models and generative AI can benefit your specific business needs?
 SPEAKER_00: Not at the moment.  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_01: No worries.  Thank you so much, Anubhav.  It was really nice talking to you.  Please take care of yourself.  Thank you.  Bye.  Bye.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hi, I'm a Google Virtual Calling Assistant recording this call for the person you're  trying to reach.  Can you see what you're calling about?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm looking for a scored heart.
 SPEAKER_00: Hello?  Hello?  Thanks, connecting you now.
 SPEAKER_02: Hello?
 SPEAKER_01: Hello?
 SPEAKER_02: Yeah, hello?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, hi, is this Scott?  It is.
 SPEAKER_02: Yes, sir?
 SPEAKER_01: Hi, Scott, how are you doing today?
 SPEAKER_02: I'm fine, thank you.
 SPEAKER_01: That's great to hear, Scott.  The reason of my call is that, Scott, my name is Joseph, and the reason of my call is I  see that you are currently working as the director of IT with Raymond Engineering, Georgia.  Is that right?
 SPEAKER_02: Yes, sir?  Yes, sir?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Scott, I'm calling you because as far as I notice, I see that your business is using  AWS services.  I just wanted to share a limited time offer that can help you leverage AI tech to grow  our business.
 SPEAKER_02: I mean, honestly, we may have signed up for a trial to look at something or anything, but  we are not currently using any AWS products at this time.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay.  I will thank you for that.  I will keep that for reference, but I just wanted to know as I am able to get in touch  with you.  I just wanted to know, I mean, your thoughts about AI and implementing it into your business.
 SPEAKER_02: We have an in-house AI project.  We are doing it in-house.  We are not.  And because of security reasons and stuff with the work that we do and stuff, we are not  interested in putting it in the cloud at this point in time.
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: Okay, so you already have an in-house AI project undergoing? Unknown Speaker: Correct.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  And any plans of, I mean, associating with Amazon?
 SPEAKER_02: We are not at this point in time.  We are not interested at this point in time of putting it in the cloud with anybody at  this point in time.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I totally understand that, but we have a lot of innovations with us.  I mean, I can just put a consultation for you for next week and you can find some insights  that may be useful and I am not asking you to make any decision at this point in time.  Just to, you know, I mean, whenever you are free, you can just have a look onto it and  somebody from our tech team, the AI experts can help you out and you can get some more  insights on that.  And we would be more than happy to get any feedback from you.
 SPEAKER_02: I appreciate that, but I don't have the bandwidth to do that right now because we are in the  middle of a security certification and that is taking up the majority of my time at this  point in time and we do have a project person that is running the AI, but like I said, it  is a small internal project and they are still trying to figure out what they want to do.  And so until they figure out what they want to do, we won't know what resources are going  to be necessary to do the project.  So no sense of looking at something if we don't even know what it is we are looking for at  this point in time.  I am still just saying I appreciate that, but at this moment they could talk about 20 things  I wouldn't know if we needed any of them.  So right now until we get a scope on the project and know exactly what they want to do going  forward, we don't even know if we want to put it in the cloud or do anything with it.  So once we get far and along with that, we will be glad to look at it and see what  the output will be right now.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay.  No issues, sir.  I really appreciate you taking the time to explain me that.  And thank you for that.  I wish you a great day, Adam.  Thank you so much for your time, sir.
 SPEAKER_02: Thank you.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, thank you.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello, yes, hi, good morning.  Am I speaking with David Knight?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, you are.  I can help you.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, hi, Mr. Knight.  My name is Hina, calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: All right.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so Mr. Knight, you're working as one of the director  of information technology at Rowling Hills Community Church,  correct?
 SPEAKER_01: That is correct.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually, that's the reason I was trying to reach out to you.  So actually, we have noticed that your organization is an AWS  customer and we just have a limited time offer that could be  valuable for your business.  So Mr. Knight, what we are doing is we are just offering a free  migration and licensing optimization assessment, which has  helped businesses like yours reduce their total cost of  ownership up to 56 percent and migrate 34 percent fastest to  the AWS cloud, which will be undertaken by TD Sinex and AWS  Partner.  So actually, I just wanted to understand that is your company  still running workloads on costly on-premises servers?
 SPEAKER_01: So I'm not sure who you got your information from, but we're  not interested in migrating to AWS.  And it sounds like you're not from AWS, you're not an AWS  group, but you're with a company that partners with AWS.  So we're not interested in your services.  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so may I just know the reason?  Like, I'm not telling you to migrate to it right now.

 SPEAKER_01: I'm fine.
 SPEAKER_00: That's great to hear, Phil.  My name is Joseph and I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  The purpose of my call is that I see that you're working as the CEO of moving image technology.  Is that right?
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: Yes, hold on. Unknown Speaker: Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, go ahead.  Yes, I'm with Moving Image Technology.
 SPEAKER_00: Yes, I'm your CEO with that company.
 SPEAKER_01: Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: That's great to hear, Phil.  Phil, I'm calling you today because as per our record, I see that your business uses AWS.  So we wanted to share a limited time offer with you that can help leverage AI tech to grow your business.  Just wanted to know your thoughts on implementing AI and also just wanted to know what use abilities you would like to have for AI in your business.
 SPEAKER_01: I don't have any idea.  You're talking the wrong guy.  As you know, I'm the CEO.  I'm not the tech.  I'm not the engineer.  I'm not the whatever.  So I don't know.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, yes, sir.  I totally understand, perfectly understand that you are not the tech guy, but that's the reason why I have called you.  The purpose of my call today is to arrange a consultation meeting with you.  So I will just drop you a mail and then arrange a consultation meeting.  You can just go through it on a free time and our AI experts will get in contact with you and we can also connect your tech team so that we can come up to a decision.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, so I saw before I'm not the guy.  So if you want to leave some kind of information, whatever, I could I don't have the information with me now because I'm at home, but I don't want to even talk about it.  I want to get somebody else that I have assigned to that.  And do you have our number for MIT?
 SPEAKER_00: Sir, I do not have the number for MIT, but that is not an issue.  I will just send you an email, like an email on your official email address and you can just have a look onto it and then you can discuss it with your tech experts and then we can work on it further.  How does this sound to you?
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, that's fine.
 SPEAKER_00: Perfect. So I will just confirm a free information.  It won't take more than a minute, sir.  Just give me some time.  So yes, I will just read out and I just need your consent on that.  So this consultation can help you improve operational efficiency and speed to market.  And would you like to share this free consultation, sir?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I can say I can barely understand what you're saying and I'm really not interested in that and I want to have somebody else handle it.  I'm not a hands-on kind of CEO.  I have other people do that.  So the decision is going to be me in the final, but I'm not interested.  And like I said right now, because of the volume and because I'm on the phone, I can barely understand what you're saying anyway.  So I appreciate the call and that's all for now.  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: I'm well.
 SPEAKER_00: That's great to hear, Sam.  Sam, the reason I'm calling you today is that I wanted to...  I see that you are a Chief Technology Officer with R&B and Front Range State Bank.  Is that right?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  That's great.  Sam, as we noticed that you are an AWS customer,  we have a limited time offer which can help reduce costs and optimize IT infrastructure for your business.  Since I see that you're already leveraging cloud resources,  I just wanted to know your thoughts on this.  I also wanted to know if you're currently running your workload on on-premise service.
 SPEAKER_01: I am not an AWS customer at this time in a long-term relationship with another vendor.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, that is actually great to hear, but we are coming with a lot of benefits to start that we are...  I mean, today, we are just offering your free migration and licensing optimization assessment,  which has helped a lot of businesses like yours to reduce the total cost of ownership by up to 56%  and also migrate 34% faster to the AWS cloud.  Now, when you say you're not an AWS customer, I understand that,  but I mean, your business has been using Ada Amazon Web Services.  We just wanted to share this assessment with you.  You do not have to make a decision right now or maybe also in this week.  I just will be sending you a mail.  Somebody will get in touch with you, fix an appointment,  and then based on your availability, we can attend that.
 SPEAKER_01: I would not be interested for at least two years.  I appreciate your time, and I hope you have a great day.
 SPEAKER_00: No worries.

 SPEAKER_01: Hi, Ablyon speaking with Samuel, Samuel Mildonado.  Who's speaking?  Hi Samuel, this is Shreya Shah.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_00: You're calling on behalf of Amazon?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  And I believe you are the Chief Operating Officer at Clouded, right?
 SPEAKER_00: Right.  Great.
 SPEAKER_01: Well, like I said, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  We observed your company has been using AWS Services.  And we wanted to offer you a pre-one hour consultation with AI professionals to assist you,  utilizing cutting edge AI technologies.  So would you like to go ahead and sign up?  You can attend it as per your convenience.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm okay right now.  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_01: Well, Samuel, is there any specific reason?  May I know why won't you go for it?
 SPEAKER_00: I don't, you know, I don't really typically get involved much on that side of it.  I have another colleague that does all that, so I'm sure he's doing all that already.
 SPEAKER_01: Of course, of course.  And see, my intention over here is not to sell you anything or, you know, or pitch you anything.  The reason I wanted to reach out to you, okay, to share this consultation, because what I believe is that since you are a Chief Operating Officer, okay,  I believe this will help you to, you know, make your whole operation process more agile.  Since, as you know, that AI has been a major part growing in this industry.  Not only your industry, but pretty much everywhere, right?
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I understand that, but I'm not the person that would do that.  I already have people that would do that. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: I'm not telling you what's up.
 SPEAKER_01: So I understand that, Samuel, but however my intention, like I said,

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Thank you for calling Asset Technology Group, your premier IT and managed service provider  for the Southeast.  Your call may be recorded for quality and training purposes.  Please hold while we forward your call to the next available technician.
 SPEAKER_01: Asset Technology Group, this is Analia.  How can I help you?
 SPEAKER_02: Hi there, Ra.  Could you help me to reach James Munn?  May I ask a calling?  My name is Robert Burr.  I'm from Amazon Web Services.  Thank you.
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: One second. Speaker Unknown Speaker: Thank you. Unknown Speaker: Hello, James.
 SPEAKER_02: Hi, Mr. James.  How are you?  I'm doing pretty good.  Great.  Mr. James, real quick.  My name is Robert Burr.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  So, you know, the reason I'm trying to reach you is to, you know, share or rather discuss  an opportunity that could help your business significantly reduce cost and optimize your  IT infrastructure.  Sir, you know, we have noticed you are an Amazon Web Services customer and we have a  limited time offer that could be available for your business.  What I'm talking about is a free, what we are offering a free migration and licensing  optimization assistance which could help businesses such as yours to reduce their total cost of  ownership up to 56% and migrate 34% faster to the AWS cloud.  And this will be undertaken by TD Sinex, one of our premier partners.  Sir, would it be okay if I go ahead or rather if anyone of my, you know, senior person, you know,  gives you a call and does the assessment to optimize the right infrastructure which potentially  saves the cost?  Would you be interested to talk to them, sir?
 SPEAKER_01: Hey Robert, what company do you work for?
 Speaker SPEAKER_02: Sir, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_02: That's not what I asked.
 SPEAKER_01: I said, who do you work for?
 SPEAKER_02: Okay, I work for a company called Hypride.  Hy what?  Hypride.
 SPEAKER_01: RIDE.
 SPEAKER_02: Yes sir, currently I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: Yep.  And how did you know or how do you know that we're an Amazon customer?
 SPEAKER_02: Well, my research team, you know, updates me, you know, that you are one of our AWS customers.  And that's the reason we are calling you to understand if you or your team would be interested  for this offer where we offer a free migration and licensing optimization assessment.
 SPEAKER_01: The free migration and licensing of what?  To what?  I'm trying to understand the pitch here that you got.  So you're going to move it from Amazon to some other cloud hosting provider?
 SPEAKER_02: Well, currently this has been done by AWS's premium partner, TD Sinex.  So I'm here only to fix and phone call appointments with the right person where they would basically call you.  I mean, from TDX they will call you to understand if you would be interested to taking this advantage of this assessment.
 SPEAKER_01: I got it.  So you're placing co-calls looking for people interested in possibly moving licensing and stuff away from Amazon?
 SPEAKER_02: Well, within Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_01: Oh, within Amazon Web Services.  So what you're offering is better pricing for Amazon Web Services?
 SPEAKER_02: Yes, sir.  That's why you can say that.  As I said that the total cost of ownership of the IT infrastructure will be reduced or up to 56% reduction on the total cost of ownership.  And also 34% you can migrate faster to the AWS cloud.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  Okay.  Well, I appreciate the call, but we actually don't use AWS anymore.  So that's the reason why I was kind of curious how you thought we were.  Okay.  But I appreciate the call, but I guess you can remove us from any list that you have since we're not an AWS customer anymore.
 SPEAKER_02: All right.  Okay.  So would you be interested to at least know what we offer?  Would you be interested to receive an email?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I think we're good.
 SPEAKER_02: All right.  Okay.  Thank you, Mr. James.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you, Robert.  Appreciate it.  Have a good day.  All right.

 SPEAKER_00: Hi, Kendra. This is Shreyash. I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services. How are you?  Fine, how are you?  I'm doing great. Thank you for asking, Kendra.  Well, Kendra, I wanted to reach out to you because you are the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Offering Officer at Menalto Advisors.
 SPEAKER_01: I am.
 SPEAKER_00: Great. Well, Kendra, like I mentioned, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  And, you know, we have been seeing that you are using AWS services and we wanted to offer you a free one hour consultation with AI professionals to assist you utilizing cutting edge technology to expand your business, which is absolutely a few costs.  And, you know, it will be an interactive interactive session with an AI expert and who will make you understand how you can use AI in your workflow in terms of financial operations.  So would you like to go for it?
 SPEAKER_01: No, thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, is there any specific reason, Kendra?
 SPEAKER_01: We're a tiny company. The accounting is very simple. We don't really need it.
 SPEAKER_00: Of course, Kendra. But you do understand that nowadays how AI is growing in the industries and vastly over the operations of every company right.  Okay. And my intention over here is not to sell or assist anything. My intention is over here, you know, where you can go and learn about AI in tomorrow, in the future, if your company is growing.  And if you have that opportunity where you go ahead and integrate AI, you will have knowledge for it.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, our company is just not growing like that. It's not that kind of company. It's a small consulting practice.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay. Okay. I do understand Kendra and the standard. Your company is just more consulting. Okay. And I hope in tomorrow if it grows, like I said, a job is not only in terms of technical.  It's just a job is to make your job easier or more autonomous process. Okay. And that's why I'm reaching out to you.  So once you have the interaction with AI expert, you will realize that, you know, how AI can help you for your organization as well, considering the fact that, you know, you say that your company is a small firm.  And plus you can attend as per your convenience. And from AWS.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, right now it's not of interest to me. But I appreciate the offer. Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: You have a good action. Thank you so much. You too. Take care. Bye.

 SPEAKER_00: Good morning, Ms. Din.
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: Good morning, Din.  My name is Alton.  I'm calling on behalf of AWS Amazon Web Services.  How are you?  Good, yourself?  I'm doing fine.  Thank you.  Din, the reason of my call is I see that you're currently working as a director of IT, like information technology with MRI steel framing, right?  That's great. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: So, Din, what part of the technology you look at?  Is it the software part or is it the infrastructure part of it?  Or both?
 SPEAKER_00: It's both.  I do the director.  But is this for changing something on our account or is this for a new service?
 SPEAKER_01: No, this is nothing to change on your account.  As I see that you are currently, as you know that you are currently using AWS services, we are offering a free migration and licensing optimization assessment that has helped businesses like yours to reduce their total cost of ownership by 56% and migrate 34% faster to AWS Cloud.  Now, that's the reason I'm just calling you so we can schedule this assessment for you.  So, like, is it okay if somebody from TDCNX can call you maybe in a couple of weeks and schedule this assessment for you?
 SPEAKER_00: You know what?  The only reason we're using AWS is just for our internal backup system for one of our ERPs.  And they're the ones that actually manage it and use it.  So I don't think that this particular service would apply to us.
 SPEAKER_01: No, this is not a service then as this is a...
 SPEAKER_00: No, I do appreciate that.  Again, I understand where you're coming from on it.  I appreciate it, but it's just not something we'd be interested in at the moment.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, Dan, no problem.  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, hello.  Is this Beth?  Beth Pelton?
 SPEAKER_01: It is, yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Hi, Beth.  How are you doing?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm good.  Thanks.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm glad to hear that.  Beth, my name is Joseph and I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  The reason I called today to you is to see, as I can see that you're all, you're working  as a senior vice president of information security with the investment group.  Is that correct?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, it is.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's great.  The reason of my call, Beth, to you is that as we notice that you are an AWS, I mean,  you use the AWS services.  So we just have come up with a limited time offer which can help reduce costs and optimize  the IT infrastructure for your business.  Now, as you're already leveraging cloud green sources, I just wanted to know your thoughts  on this and also wanted to know if your business is currently running, I mean, the workload  that your business is running is from on-premise servers.
 SPEAKER_01: We're not interested in that because we have a third party that takes care of that portion  of our network.  So they do all of the contracting and negotiating.
 SPEAKER_00: Yes, I totally understand that a third party is using it but we are not asking you to come  up with the decision.  We have come up with options which is offering you much better than, I mean, of course, a  more competitive option or an alternative.  Now, you can actually go through this particular assessment that we have for you for a free  time.  All I need to do is to send you a mail and you just have to have a look on it on your  free time and then we can discuss about it.
 SPEAKER_01: The timing is not right for us.  We have a couple of other projects that are going to take precedence over this.  So I really can't devote the time to it right now.  But I appreciate the offer and I appreciate you reaching out.  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: That's perfectly fine.

 SPEAKER_00: Hi.  Hi, Dada.  Am I, I believe I'm speaking with Zachary.  Zachary Pinay, right?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, how can I help you?
 SPEAKER_00: Hi, Zachary.  This is Shreyash.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Good.
 SPEAKER_00: That's wonderful to know.  Well, Zach, we have observed your company has been using AWS services, and we wanted to reach out to you, because I believe you're the director of the Nouns at Dawn Thought and Automotive.
 SPEAKER_01: No, I'm just a, like a salesman.  So I don't have any decision making power about Amazon Web Services or anything like that, so you're definitely not talking to the right person.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, if I'm not wrong, but I believe that you hold the position of director at finance, like director of finance.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't believe you understand what that means in the car business, though.  Basically, like a sales manager.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  Okay, so you're a sales manager.  Okay.  Okay.  Well, in that case, okay, I will make note of it.  However, my intention is not to look for any decision maker or something like that.  The reason I wanted to reach out to you, because since your company is using AWS for quite a long time, I know AWS is offering a free one-hour consultation with the AI professionals.  Okay.  And you can use this AI consultation to utilize this cutting edge technology to, you know, in the workflow of sales.  Okay.  So would you like to go ahead and sign up for it?  It's a free, is there any specific reason for that?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't really want to sign up for anything from a random caller that says anonymous on my phone.  That is not safe.  It's just not a good idea.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I do understand your point of view as well.
 SPEAKER_01: Maybe you can put the phone read Amazon Web Services instead of anonymous.  You know, that might be a pretty good start.  But no, I'm not going to sign up for anything on a random phone call that was pulled off of the website.
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Of course, of course.  Jack, I do understand your point of view as well. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: But that's why I'm not going to, you know, it's first of all, it's a free consultation.  And second, you can, you will receive an email where you can, you know, you'll get all the information what this, you know, this consultation is going to be about how AI is going to help you in the sales process.  And also, you can choose it as for your convenience.  I mean, you know, you can attend it as for your convenience.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  No, I'm not going to do that.  Thank you so much for calling, but I'm just not going to do that.
 SPEAKER_00: I do understand.  But it was a nice talking to you, Jack.  Please take care of yourself.  Thank you.  Have a nice day.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: Bye.
 SPEAKER_00: Bye.

 SPEAKER_01: Hello, Ms. Harrison.  Hi, Harrison.  This is Shreyesh.  I'm calling on behalf of...  How is detection?  How are you?
 SPEAKER_00: On behalf of what?  On behalf of what?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_00: Got you, buddy.  Hey, so this is a sales call.  This is a work line.  You're not allowed to call these.
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: Well, this is not a sales call.  Actually, the object of company has been used to provide a service call. Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: I believe you are the sales director of Northridge Toyota, right?
 SPEAKER_00: No, I'm not a service director of Northridge Toyota.  I'm not one of the managers.  I'm not a sales director of Northridge Toyota.  What was this regarding?
 SPEAKER_01: Well, like I said, I believe you are the sales director of Northridge Toyota.  And I believe also that Northridge has been using the AWS services.  So I want to...  Got you.
 SPEAKER_00: So I'm not in a management position to make any kind of changes to the company, so I  am the wrong person.  You can call in direct to the main line and ask to speak with anybody in management.  They might be able to point you in the right direction, but that would not be me.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, good.
 SPEAKER_00: If you're just calling about different services that Northridge Toyota is set up on, you can  call back through the direct to main line and then you can ask to speak with anybody  in management.  They might be able to point you in a better direction.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, sure.  I'll do that.  But I want to understand, you said you're not the sales director.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm not a sales director now.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  Just to keep my data updated, you can say to make sure that you don't receive any calls.  That would be wonderful.  Okay.  Can you help me understand what designation you're working?
 SPEAKER_00: Sure.  I'm in internet sales.  I'm in one of the internet sales managers, but I'm not in a position where I can make  any kind of financial decisions for the company.  So that would be a difference.  That would definitely be somebody else.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  Okay.  As you have already mentioned, I will go ahead and reach out to that person.  Thank you.  I understand.  However, the only thing is that my intention is not to sell anything or not I'm looking  for a disarm maker.  I understand.
 SPEAKER_00: I understand even if you're looking at making contacts or building relationships, I still  wouldn't be the right person to do that because I have no, speaking to me at this point is  going to do no bearing in helping your business.  You would need to speak with one of the other managers depending on what department it is  who can actually make any kind of financial decisions or build contacts to help out.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you once again, Harrison.  But again, like I said, the only reason I wanted to reach out to you is because you  know, since your company is using AWS, Amazon Web Services, we wanted to offer you a free  one-hour consultation with your professional to make you know, answer your, how you can  use AI in, you know, you can say that in internet sales and how you can leverage the  AI technology to expand your business and make your whole sales process easier.  So I just want to see if you are up for it.
 SPEAKER_00: No, it's okay.  I thank you though.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  Well, is there a reason for that?
 SPEAKER_00: I wish you the best.  Thank you.

So the reason actually, you know, I was calling is because AWS wanted to discuss an exciting  opportunity with you, which is for small and medium-sized businesses like yours to explore  generative AI solutions.  We have actually, yeah.
 SPEAKER_01: I must say with some time, we are part of Zimmer Biomet.  And Zimmer Biomet controls all our purchasing and spending.  And they do use Amazon for stuff.  So I can't add any, I'm not in control of any of that.
 SPEAKER_00: Absolutely.  No, no, you're getting me absolutely wrong.  I'm not here to sell you anything.  And the reason actually, you know, I was calling is because AWS is actually a wanted, you know,  for an one-hour consultation with an AI expert.  I believe you must be, you know, interested in implementing artificial intelligence, generative  artificial intelligence in your current day-to-day work, right, in operations.
 SPEAKER_01: I can't do any of that.  No, no, no.  Everything is by corporate.  I actually have a meeting I have to go to.  So I can't, I don't have any control over IT purchasing or anything.
 SPEAKER_00: All right.  I know what he's saying.  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello, yes, I'm speaking with Michael Rice.
 SPEAKER_01: Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Hi, Mike.  My name is Hina, calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  So you told me to call back, right?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  So, I'm going to call you back.  So, Mike, you're working as one of the chief executive officers at Capstone Direct, correct?
 SPEAKER_01: That's correct.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually, that's the reason I was trying to reach out to you.  So, Mike, actually, the reason for my call is that we have noticed that your business  has been using Amazon Web Services, and we just wanted to share a limited time offer  that could help you leverage AI technology to grow your business.  So, Mike, have you ever thought of implementing like AI in your line of business  and your day-to-day operations?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  So, I've pretty much paused that Capstone business at this point in time,  and so I'm not focusing on that business.  So, I appreciate the call, but no, I'm not interested right now.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm not telling you to implement anything right away.  If you're just interested in learning how a generative AI foundation could benefit your specific business needs,  what we are doing is we are offering a program that creates the best practice generative AI foundation  with all the tools needed to quickly integrate AI into your business,  and you can just take a look into it.  Someone from Innovator Solutions would like to get in touch with you,  and he'll explain in details.
 SPEAKER_01: I don't want to waste your time on it, so, yeah, you don't need to have anybody call me.  Thank you, though.

 SPEAKER_00: What services?
 SPEAKER_01: Amazon Web Services?
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, I'm all right.

 SPEAKER_01: Like I said, I'm calling from behalf of Amazon Web Services,  and we observe your company has been using AWS services,  and we wanted to offer you a free one-hour consultation with AI professionals  to assist you how you can utilize AI with cutting-edge AI technologies  to expand your business and improve your workflow.  Now, I believe you are the Chief Technology Officer, right?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I mean, so we sold the company to Intel.  Okay.  So, yeah, we don't, yeah, we're not building out any more cloud or anything else like that.  We're, yeah, within cell now and irresponsible for everything.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, okay, see, but my intention is, like I said, is not to make any decisions  or to buy or something.  The reason I wanted to reach out to you, since your company is using AWS,  okay, I wanted to introduce you to a scenario,  to introduce to our AI expert who will be helping you and guiding you  how you can implement AI in your workflow to increase the productivity as well.  Okay, nowadays you know how AI has taken over the world  and how the companies are using it to leverage it for their, you know,  for better workflow and to make the whole process agile, right?  And once you go and sign up for this, this consultation can help you to improve  operational speed to go up.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but what I'm saying, though, is that if anything, we're spinning down all operations.  Mm-hmm.  We're not going to have an actual, you know, company outstanding anymore.  We're actually part of Intel.  That is absolutely.  Yeah, we're not going to be doing any more cloud stuff.  We're like, everything is, everything is Intel now.  Anyway, thanks for calling.  I'm going to get back to work.  Bye.

As we have noticed your business has BQ's AWS services and we wanted to share a free  consultation offer that could help you to leverage cutting edge AI technology to grow  your business.  So are you interested in learning how large language models and generative AI can benefit  your specific business needs?  Actually we are offering a free one hour consultation with AI expert to help you.  So is it okay if I go ahead and register you?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't believe so at this time.  Again I'm not, I don't involve myself in that project.  I can hand you over to Alan Poliska, he's handling it.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: But I know that we've hired a third party to kind of do all this for us.

Mission cloud would be provided with the project title, project description, project revenue  estimate to AWS and the project timeline.  Sounds good?
 SPEAKER_00: No thank you but yeah if you send me an email with all that stuff I would be happy to review  it.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay I will send you an email, you can go through it.  And if you find it relevant then okay.  And hello?  Yep.  Hello.  Yeah.  Yes I'm here.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello, this is Reggie.
 SPEAKER_00: Hello, Reggie.  Good morning.  I hope you're doing well.  I am.  You're calling?  All right.  Reggie, my name is Chen.  I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  I see you are the president and CEO at One Source Franchising.  Would that be great?
 SPEAKER_01: It is, yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Wonderful.  I see your company is using Amazon Web Services.  That's the only reason today.  Amazon Web Services would like you to discuss an exciting opportunity for small and medium-sized  businesses like yours to explore General DVI.  So, Reggie, have you ever thought of implementing AI into your operation?
 SPEAKER_01: I appreciate the phone call, but I'm not actually actively using Amazon Web Services.  I think I was using it just for the mobile desktop or something like that for a period of time.  I no longer have a need for that.  I no longer have remote staff that have a need for that.  I have some other options available.  So, I discontinued using that service, maybe six to ten months.  So, I guess going forward, I may still have an account, but it's not something that I'm actively using.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: All right.  Well, but many organizations after implementing AI, they have huge impact on their businesses.  So, have you ever thought of implementing AI into your operations or maybe into your organization?  Maybe any other tools, maybe sales, marketing, or business?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I really, at this point, I'm still a small boutique business, just myself, and I have a couple of virtual staff.  So, at this point, it's not something I have a need for.  Okay?
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: All right.  No worry.
 SPEAKER_00: But Reggie, I just want to let you know that by using General DVI, Artificial Intelligence,  you can improve your communications in IT operations, biothermetic answering, giving an update in the real time,  and make it easier for the team to work together as well.  And this AI can help you in important roles, simplify paths in optimizing and automating various CBS field operations functions, you know.  So, this can be improved your field operations, but productivity.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  None of that is applicable for me like I've been saying.  I'm a really small business and I don't have any use for any of this.  And so, I'm just a small consulting company.  And I appreciate the phone call though, and you have a wonderful rest of your day, sir.
 SPEAKER_00: No worries.  Thank you so much for your time.  Enjoy your day, Reggie.  Thank you.

I'll go ahead and schedule this session for you.  And so the same information I'll go ahead and give it to you  by email.  That sounds good.
 SPEAKER_00: We already have it.
 SPEAKER_01: You're already using AWS services.  That's the reason I'm trying to get industry to you  regarding this information, which is complementary for you.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, if it's AWS, no, I apologize.  You can send it to somebody else, though.  I'm not the right person to talk to.
 SPEAKER_01: Well, Robert, you didn't have to take any decision.  May I know the reason, please?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm not the technology guy.
 SPEAKER_01: He's not of our technology.  Let me give you a short information about it.  Because we just want to talk about it.

 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm still not the right person.  Like, I got people to do all this, man.  I got a staff of people that do this for us  and then make recommendations to me  as opposed to me pushing it down to them.
 SPEAKER_01: No, like, you don't have to take any decision.  You don't have to give any specific time for it.  Like I just told you.  No.  The rest of this information, it's not,  okay, nobody about it, Robert.  All right.
 SPEAKER_00: Send it to Scott Grabowski.

 SPEAKER_00: I don't want somebody to call me back.  I'm not the right person.  How many times do I have to say it?
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, no worries about it, Robert.  Well, I appreciate your time.  You have a good day.  Bye-bye.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hello?
 SPEAKER_01: Hey, am I talking to Justin Pinkesign at Sego Home Loan?  Who is this?  Yeah, this is Phoebe Justin and I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_00: I'm okay.  What can I do for you at the moment?
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  So Justin, I believe you are the Chief Technology Officer.  Is that correct?
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yes. Unknown Speaker: Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: So the reason behind my call today is that we have noticed your business has been using  AWS services and so I just wanted to share a limited time offer to help you leverage  Generative AI to grow your business.
 SPEAKER_00: Actually, I apologize.  We're not interested.  Thank you anyway.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no problem Justin.  This is actually not a sales call.  I'm not trying to sell you a product or service whatsoever.  I was just trying to have a brief talk about leveraging Generative AI and I just had a  question to ask you about it.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm just saying we don't use Generative AI in the mortgage space right now.  We just hasn't caught up to AI.  I'm the only technical employee here.  So I mean it's going to be years until I have any bandwidth to either hire somebody or to  even start developing that way.  So I only say we're not interested not because of the money but because I don't have the  resources for anything like that anytime soon.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's okay Justin.  I actually contacted you because if you are okay in learning how AI can help you out with  day to day processes to ease it out, we are actually offering an hour free consultation  with our AI experts.  So would you be okay in scheduling the consultation that's there?
 SPEAKER_00: No, thank you.  I appreciate the call.  Thank you anyway for the offer.  Hello.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  Yeah, no, yeah.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, all right.  Thank you so much.  You have a great day.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, me too.
 SPEAKER_00: Bye-bye.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.
 SPEAKER_00: Hey, hi Mr. King, and how are you?  Great, I'm doing good too, thank you very much for asking.  You won't take much of your time.  My name is Jason.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services, AWS.  Mr. King, the reason actually I was calling is because  AWS wanted to discuss an exciting opportunity for small and medium businesses like yours  to explore a generative AI solution.  So I believe I'm talking to Chief Executive Officer with Animation Mentor.  Is that correct?  Yes, that's correct.  Wonderful.  So Mr. King, we have noticed that your business has been using AWS services.  So AWS wanted to share a free consultation offer that could help you leverage cutting-edge AI technology to grow your business.  So have you ever thought of implementing AI technology in your current work frame?
 SPEAKER_01: We do, but it's probably not of interest at this point in time.  I appreciate the call.
 SPEAKER_00: I completely understand that, sir.  So the reason why we at AWS wanted to get in touch with you is because AWS is actually offering a free one-hour consultation with AI experts  to help you understand how you can leverage, learn how large language models and generative AI can benefit your specific business needs.  And this one, our consultation, would be according to your time.  You would be receiving an email from AWS where you can schedule this one-hour free consultation.
 SPEAKER_01: But that's okay. We don't need it. I appreciate the call, though. Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Mr. King, is that all right if I can share all the information on your email so that you can have a look at it accordingly?
 SPEAKER_01: That's okay. Not this time, though, but I appreciate it.
 SPEAKER_00: No worries. Thank you so much for your time. You have a great day.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you. You too.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hi Brian.
 SPEAKER_01: Hi Brian, this is Shreya.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  We just had a conversation, if you remember.  About what?  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_00: Amazon Web Services, okay. I don't do anything with Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_01: Well, this is not regarding that. The reason I wanted to reach out to you, because I believe you are the CEO and president of Financial Recovery Services, right?
 SPEAKER_00: Well, yeah, that's true, but we don't do anything. All of our software that's utilized is utilized to a reseller, and they handle all of that. So we don't do anything like that.  Absolutely understand.  It's not under our control.
 SPEAKER_01: I understand, Brian, but see, my purpose over here is not to sell anything or, you know, or rather I say pitch anything. Okay.  The only intention over here is because AWS wanted to, you know, we wanted to offer you a free one-hour consultation with AI professionals to assist you.  So you can understand how you can utilize the cutting edge AI technologies.
 SPEAKER_00: No, no, no, no. Just take me off of your vest like I mentioned. We do everything through a reseller that handles our industry software.  So we don't do anything with that. I don't even have any control over it. So you can just, like I said, remove us off of it.
 SPEAKER_01: Sure, Brian, if you want so, I'll go ahead and do that. But I just want to, before I let you go, I just want to understand one question.  Now, being a CEO of the company and president, okay, you understand that there are a lot of businesses have seen significant benefits, you know, from implementing AI solutions, right?
 SPEAKER_00: I don't know. I know the benefits. I know all of that. As I mentioned previously, we don't have the ability to do it even if we wanted to because we purchase our software through a reseller and they host everything.  Okay. So we don't have that option. Okay. So you don't even have to talk to me anymore about it because there's no need to.
 SPEAKER_01: I get that point, Brian, but I want to understand like for education.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello, am I speaking with Julia Bates?  It depends on who's calling.  My name is Sam, and I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services, AWS.
 SPEAKER_01: OK.  Yeah.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so Julia, I believe you are a project manager  with ASRock partners, correct?
 SPEAKER_01: That is correct.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, actually, we have noticed that your business has been already using AWS services,  and we just wanted to share a free consultation offer that could help you to leverage cutting  HAI technology to grow your business.  So if we are interested in learning how large language models and generative AI can benefit  your specific business needs, we are offering a free consultation with AI Expert to help  you.  So are you currently using generative AI for your business?
 SPEAKER_01: I actually will be honest.  I am not a decision maker at my company, so I am not at liberty to say yes or no to this  offer.  So I am grateful that you called, but I'm going to have to decline.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, no, so actually, you don't have to make any decision or anything like that.  We are contacting you because you are a project manager, and this is not a technical thing.  This is a non-technical, and this is just to give you some knowledge about generative  AI and how it can be useful for your current use case and business goals.  And you can also explore industry-specific AI applications.  So that's the only reason why we are reaching out to you.  So would you like to schedule this free consultation?
 SPEAKER_01: I am not interested at this time, but thank you so much.  I appreciate it, and I hope you have a good rest of your day.  Take care.
 SPEAKER_00: All right then.  Thank you so much.  Have a nice day.
 SPEAKER_01: Bye-bye.
 SPEAKER_00: Bye.

 SPEAKER_01: No.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, that's what our company is.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, yeah, Ryan.  I'm actually calling on behalf of Amazon Services.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, is Amazon interested?  Sorry?  So you're calling for Amazon to join out one of our memberships?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services because I see you are the sales director at Nicholas Air.  Is that correct?
 SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry?
 SPEAKER_01: I believe you are the sales director at Nicholas Air.  Is that correct?
 SPEAKER_00: Yes.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, so the reason behind my call today is that we have noticed your business has been using Amazon Web Services.  So I just wanted to share a limited time offer to help you leverage, generate AI to grow your business.  And I just wanted to ask you, have you ever thought of implementing AI in your day-to-day operations to increase their efficiency?
 SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry, use Amazon for our...
 SPEAKER_01: Amazon Web Services, Ryan.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  And I just wanted to ask, have you ever thought of implementing AI to, you know, day-to-day operations to increase their efficiency, generate AI?
 SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.  Who's AI?  I don't think I've spoke with them.
 SPEAKER_01: Artificial Intelligence, Ryan.  Have you ever thought of implementing Generative AI?  Because, you know, it can help you in a lot of ways like customer and stakeholder management.  Then there is talent and team management, performance monitoring, financial oversight, and many other things.  Like, so if you're interested in learning how more it can help you in gaining insights,  we are actually offering an R-free consultation with our AI experts.  So would it be okay for you to, you know, schedule that consultation?
 SPEAKER_00: Is that like, like, central intelligence, like the CIA?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it is artificial intelligence, you know, Generative AI, to help ease out your day-to-day operations.  And right now we are basically offering a free one-hour consultation with our AI experts.  And regarding that, I called you.  Would you be, like, interested in scheduling that consultation?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  And you guys are in town?  You just want to come by the office?
 SPEAKER_01: No, no.  It would be a virtual, Ryan.  Our, you know, Mission Cloud Partner will call you to regarding that.  So would it be okay for you to schedule that consultation?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, we only do in-person meetings.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  So basically it will be virtually and you just have to sit there and, you know,  they'll tell you about everything, every aspect of how Generative AI can help you in your day-to-day operations  and, you know, achieve your business goals and the specific business needs.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  What I can do is I can get with our scheduler and anytime you guys want to come by the office.  Sorry, hello.  You can come into the office.
 SPEAKER_01: Sorry, Aya and I could not hear you.  Could you please repeat that?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I was just saying I'll get with our scheduler and figure out some good times for you guys to come swing by the office and have a meet-up.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's understandable, Ryan, but actually you can schedule it according to your preference at any time that you want.  Our partner will call you after a week or two and, you know, you can take it from there that way.  Do you want to schedule the consultation and whenever you want it totally upon you and also it's not about decision-making and it will be virtual, obviously.  So for that, our partner will call you.  So right now I just wanted to ask if you are interested in-  I couldn't understand that.
 SPEAKER_00: You say that again?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  So basically after a couple of weeks our mission cloud partner is going to-  Hello.  Yeah, hello.
 SPEAKER_00: Sorry, you're cutting in and out.  I couldn't understand.  You said someone's going to come by the office.
 SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no.  Someone is going to make a call.  Someone is going to call you and then you can schedule the consultation according to your availability.  You don't have to rush in scheduling it like in this week or next.  You can schedule it according to your preference and feasibility.  Someone is going to call you after a couple of weeks.  I just right now wanted to consent whether you want to-
 SPEAKER_00: Would you guys want to meet like at a Starbucks or something?
 SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, no.  It is going to be virtual, Ryan.  Deport me?  It is going to be virtual, not in-person meeting but a virtual consultation.
 SPEAKER_00: I don't know what a deport conversation is.
 SPEAKER_01: Virtual, virtual.  Online.
 SPEAKER_00: Deportual?
 SPEAKER_01: Virtual online, online consultation.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure what that is.
 SPEAKER_01: It is going to be an online consultation.  You don't have to meet in person.  It's going to be on a laptop, online, on a computer, online consultation.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, but we can just meet like at a Starbucks or like a Trader Joe's or any of the coffee places around.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that could have been possible, Ryan, but that's not like right now going.  Like, not only online meetings are going, only online consultations.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, no, we do in person meetings all the time.  Yeah, but that's not in our policy.  It's a group of somebody at a somebody office.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I totally understand, Ryan, but that is actually not in our policy.  So in-person meetings are basically not done.  Everything is online at these days, right?  And this consultation is also about how AI can help you with your day-to-day operations and ease your life out.  So it's going to be online.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so you guys aren't in town?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, no.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so we only work with vendors that are in town.
 SPEAKER_01: So you're not okay with scheduling the online consultation?
 SPEAKER_00: No, I'm sorry. It would have to be in person, but if you want to meet at like a coffee shop or something, we would be happy to meet.
 SPEAKER_01: No, Ryan, that's not in the policy.  So if you're not okay with the online consultation, should I like go ahead and send you an email with all the content of the same, like how AI can help you?  So if it is okay, sending an email.
 SPEAKER_00: But I thought you said we couldn't meet.
 SPEAKER_01: No, no, Ryan, I can't actually meet you.  Instead, the meeting is only going to be online.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, well, we can't do that, unfortunately. It would have to be in person.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, if I could send you an email if it is okay for you instead of, you know, the virtual meeting if it's not okay for you.  Like should I go ahead and send you an email with all the content in it about Generative AI?
 SPEAKER_00: So if you send the email, then I'll meet with one of your team in person?
 SPEAKER_01: No, Ryan, actually meeting is off the table right now.  No, we're not able to meet.  So you can, you know, go through the content.  When I send you the email, you can go through the content.  And you can actually read how Generative AI can help you with all your day-to-day operations and keep your business goals, your targets and everything.  So you can basically read it at any convenient time with your...  So should I go ahead and send you the email?
 SPEAKER_00: No, it's okay. I appreciate it, though.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, Ryan, thank you for your time, though. It was great talking to you.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you.  Bye.

 SPEAKER_01: Hi, Rachael.  This is Shreyesh.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_00: I'm sorry.  I forgot the company you said.  Amelina Services?
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: No, no, no.  My name is Shreyesh.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  Oh, Amazon, yes.  Yeah.  Okay.  You might have heard about it. Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: A little bit, yeah.
 SPEAKER_01: Great.  Well, the reason I wanted to reach out to you,  because I believe you are the Vice President of Online Systems,  right?
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, no, this is for Amazon Web Services,  service you're looking for?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so I believe you are the Vice President of Online Systems,  right?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm a decision maker.  I tell you, you know what, years ago,  I forget why we had this recurring charge  that was coming because we had the Amazon Web Services or something,  and it was like they would take out like $10 every month,  or $7 every month, but when you get,  you can never call a person number.  So it was the undifficult,  I think it was an erroneous charge, whatever,  but they kept on deducting money out of our account,  but there was no customer service phone number,  so you can't talk to a person, you know what I mean?  So for that reason, I would never ever do anything with the Amazon services,  ever, because in life you've got to give people a phone number  and customer service, but they just didn't want to do that.  So anyway, so for that reason, I would never do anything with them,  because you're not going to ever talk to a person,  except for the one that helps you get on board the service, you know?
 SPEAKER_01: You know what, Rich, I do understand what you're trying to say over here,  and if I'd be in your place, I would have done the same.  Okay, but how about you give me one minute, okay?  One minute to make you understand why the reason I'm reaching out to you.  Sounds great to you?
 SPEAKER_00: No, it doesn't, but thank you very much.  Sorry about that.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello, this is John.
 SPEAKER_00: Mr. Abraham, hi.  Good afternoon.  It's me, Grace, again.  I called you in the morning.  You were busy.  I can talk a little bit more now.  Okay, sure, sure.  I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Wave Services,  and how are you?
 SPEAKER_01: All right, how are you?
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, I'm good too.  Thank you so much for asking.  So, Mr. Abraham, the reason I called is that you are one of the  partners with FOLIO Law.  Well, we...  Yes, that is the reason I'm calling you because we have noticed  your business has been using AWS services,  and for that, we wanted to share a free consultation offer  that could help you leverage cutting HAI to grow your business.  And, Joe, I wanted to understand here,  have you ever thought of implementing AI,  or have you ever tried using AI for your line of business?
 SPEAKER_01: When you say our line of business,  I guess the answer is potentially,  but it would have to be very targeted.  And I guess I'm curious what specifically you have in mind.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, actually, we are offering a one-hour free consultation  with our AI experts because this can help you improve  operational efficiency and speed to market  because many businesses have seen significant benefits  from implementing AI solutions.  And also, would you be interested in learning how large  language models and generative AI can benefit your specific business needs?
 SPEAKER_01: Probably not.  I mean, that's kind of what I wanted to get into  was just figuring where you were going with this.  We use AI, but we don't use it in a generative fashion.  We use it to go through very large batches of data,  and we're using some very custom-built tools,  some of which we're actually building ourselves.  So I don't think we're probably interested in a very high-level introduction,  but if there was something very specific that you wanted to talk about,  then that would be, you know, maybe.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, Joe, for now, I'm not asking you to make any changes.  I'm just calling to let you know that we are also offering this one-hour free consultation.  And then you can learn more about it, about how you can improve this operational efficiency.  And so would you like me to share you the details on your email?
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: If you want to send me an email, I'm happy to take a look. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  I guess it doesn't sound like it's a good fit for what we do, but that's okay.
 SPEAKER_00: Sure.  You can go ahead and check it out.  I'll share you the details.  Correct me.  Joseph.Abraham at foliolaw.com.  Will that be right?
 SPEAKER_01: That is correct, yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  And Joe, can I also let you know that I will also share you the details of this one-hour consultation,  I mean, free one-hour consultation on your email.  And then in a couple of days, you will get a call from the consultation team,  and then you can schedule this according to your convenience time, okay?
 SPEAKER_01: If you want to, that's fine.  But as of right now, I'm not sure it's going to be a productive call from your consultation team  until after I see the, see what you send me by email.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  So I will share you the details then.  And then also before I wrap up, I wanted to let you know that, would you also like AWS  to share your contact information, title, company, and the details of this project with Mission Cloud,  so that they may contact you by email for a phone to assist you.  And in addition to your name, email and phone number, Mission Cloud will be provided with a project title,  project description, project revenue, estimates to AWS, and the project timeline, okay?
 SPEAKER_01: And I'm sorry, I share with whom?
 SPEAKER_00: Mission Cloud.
 SPEAKER_01: I don't know what that is.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, Mission Cloud is one of the partners with AWS, Amazon Web Services.  So AWS would like to share your contact information, title, company, and the details of this project with Mission Cloud.  So that they may contact you by...
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's fine.  But there is no, so I mean, there is no project at the moment, and I do not want you to share my contact information with another third party.
 SPEAKER_00: You do not want us to share your details with Mission Cloud?
 SPEAKER_01: No.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, no problem then.  Thank you for your time.
 SPEAKER_01: If you want to...  I don't have enough of a sense of what this is yet, so at this point, I don't want it getting spread out to other vendors.
 SPEAKER_00: All right, no problem.  Thank you for your time.  You have a good day.
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: All right, you too. Unknown Speaker: All right.

So, have you ever thought implementing the JAI services in your day-to-day operations  to increase efficiency?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure about that one, sir.  And I'm really not part of the decision making of any tools that we might use in the company.  It would be our accounting department that normally handles that.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  So, Brigade, you are getting me wrong here.  I am not asking you to make any decisions, right?  The reason behind my call is to offer you with one hour free consultation with the AI experts.  And it's an only complimentary, actually.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello, this is Seth Elmore.
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Sorry, Mr. Elmore.  Good afternoon.  Hi. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: My name is Grace.  I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Wave Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Not too bad, I mean, how are you?
 SPEAKER_00: I mean, I'm good.  I'm good.  Thank you for asking.  Actually, Seth, you are the division project manager,  post-construction stormwater maintenance with Miller erosion control, right?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, ma'am.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  So looking at your profile, Amazon Wave Services would like to discuss an exciting opportunity  for you to explore generative AI solutions.  Also, we have noticed your business has been using services, AWS.  And since many businesses have seen significant benefits from implementing AI solutions,  Seth, we are offering a one-hour free consultation with AI experts to help you improve operational  efficiency and speed to market.  So I would like to share this details video on your email.  And also, I would like to go ahead and share Delio for the consultation.  Would you help me with your email?
 SPEAKER_01: Is it as, say, more as...  That would also not even be my decision to make A, but B, we've already got a marketing team to help with all of those kinds of things.  But I very much appreciate the interest.  And, you know, we just don't have any use for it currently.  We have, you know, our marketing team has already got stuff implemented and in place for, you know,  improving market research and tracking abilities and all that good stuff.
 SPEAKER_00: Seth, can I also add that this is not a sales call.  Actually, I'd like to share a free consultation offer with our AI experts as you are one of the project manager here.  I mean, you do not have to make any decisions.  Also, you can schedule this consultation according to your convenience time.  So, I mean, would you like me to share you the details with you?
 SPEAKER_01: So, are you offering an AI program that is supposed to help with managing sales?  Are you asking for consultation for input on this AI consultation?  I guess I'm confused about what it is you're exactly...  May I ask...
 SPEAKER_00: It's a free consultation that could help you leverage cutting-edge AI to grow your business.  So, have you used AI?  I mean, have you implemented AI?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, so, again, you're talking about business growth and that's not handled A by me, but B, it's, again, it's something that we've been offered before.  The company is not interested in using AI generated sales leads and things of that nature.  We use internal software that has already been purchased and is currently in use.
 SPEAKER_00: I totally understand that.
 SPEAKER_01: No, I appreciate it.
 SPEAKER_00: I get it, Seth.  I'm not asking you to make any changes.  Well, we just wanted to...  I mean, if you're interested, you can go ahead and join the free consultation and get the knowledge about the details.
 SPEAKER_01: No, ma'am.  I'm personally not interested either.  I very much appreciate you reaching out.  But, you know, I personally don't need AI generated sales leads or business growth development for my own personal thing.  I don't deal with that half of the business.  So, again, I appreciate the sales pitch and all the things, but I just...  I don't have them used for it at this time.
 SPEAKER_00: Sure.  Thank you for your time.  Have a good day.
 SPEAKER_01: No problem.  You as well.  Bye.

 SPEAKER_00: All right.  This is Mr. Andrew Diefle, right?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  Mr. Diefle, my name is Grace.  I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Wave Services.  I hope you're doing good today.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  Good to hear that.  So the reason I call is that you are the director of IT, right?  With Kors Lahneman, talent genius, correct?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
 SPEAKER_00: So that is why I'm calling today because we, Amazon Wave Services would like to discuss  an opportunity that could help your business significantly reduce cost and optimize your  IT infrastructure.  And we have noticed you're an AWS customer and we have a limited time offer that could  be valuable for your business.  So Andy, the reason I call is that we are offering a free migration and licensing optimization  assessment that has helped businesses like yours reduce their total cost of ownership  by up to 56% and migrate 24% faster to AWS Cloud.  So this will be undertaken by CDCNX, an AWS Premier partners.  Your company is still running work logs on Kors Lahn Permitted Service.
 SPEAKER_01: So I would like to share you.  Stop.  I am not going to do that.  I just spent half a million dollars on on-prem stuff.  I'm going to migrate.
 SPEAKER_00: Andy, I'm not asking you to do any changes here.  Yeah.
 SPEAKER_01: I just just put in new infrastructure.  I'm not going to do crap in considering putting things out to the cloud.  Thank you.  Have a good day.

 SPEAKER_00: Hi, am I speaking to Wasilis?  Wasilis, this is Shreyash.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?  I'm doing well.  How am I doing?  Great.  Well, the reason I wanted to reach out to you,  because I believe you're the director of IT at Friendly  Franchises Corporation.  Right.  Well, we have been observing, you know,  your company has been using AWS services.  And we wanted to offer you a free one-hour consultation  with an AI professional to assist you,  where you will learn how you can use,  utilizing cutting edge AI technologies  to increase the workflow in IT sector,  or as well as to expand your business.  So would you like to sign up?  You can attend the time for your convenience.
 SPEAKER_01: OK, so let me know.  I will not go into, you know, to do anything with AWS,  not because you're the bad or good,  because right now we're Microsoft, the whole architecture.  And I don't think that, you know,  they're going to approve something to live.  It's going to be a big deal.  So, yeah, I don't see it happen.  And we don't have the time and the money to migrate  and all that stuff.  OK, I'm really planning with you.  Yeah, it's not good.  I understand you're more scalable, you pay for whatever you use,  etc., but I don't think that they're going to live.  I'm telling you straight.  That's not going to happen.
 SPEAKER_00: Of course, Vasili, and I do get your point as well.  However, see, my intention over here  is not to sell you anything or, you know,  not to push for AWS or something.  The reason I wanted to reach out to you,  because I believe that being a director of IT,  you do understand the importance of AI in the industry,  you know, in every company, right?  Nowadays, AI, artificial intelligence,  you do understand how much artificial intelligence  is important, how many businesses, you know,  have gone ahead and seen the significant benefits with it.  By applying those AI solutions.  And that's what AWS wanted to offer you, you know.  We just wanted to offer you one, you know,  free consultation with one of our AI experts,  where you will be asking questions,  understanding how AI can help you,  not only in terms of your business,  but as well as in terms of your workflow as well.  OK, which you can, and it's not like you have to attend it right now,  you can attend it as per your convenience.
 SPEAKER_01: Again, I'm not a free, I know, but I don't have the time,  and I don't think that it's going to be beneficial,  because we had a thing like that two years ago,  nothing happened.  It's not me, it's not like I need to go somewhere  because, you know, you're cheaper than they,  they don't want to do anything right now.  Until, you know, the economy stabilizes somehow,  all this, you know, comes like two major conditions.  I don't think that's going to happen.  That's why I mean like it's going to be,  it's not that I'm declined like Perse, the meeting,  it's just, it's not going to go anywhere.  So, with both of us, we're losing time,  I mean like probably in two, three years,  if they have any will to do something.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah? OK.  But I know, I know.  My question is like, wouldn't you like to learn  about generative AI and how you can use it best practices?  Because this construction can help you to, you know,  improve the operational efficiency as well in your workflow.  Wouldn't you like to learn about it?
 SPEAKER_01: Well, let me just, yeah, I won't,  but this is not going to benefit anyone right now  because I'm not going to use it.  So, after like six months, not even six months,  in the second month, I will forget everything  because I don't have anything, you know, to play around  or migrate something or create whatever  from a container or virtual machine.  Actually, we bought a virtual server here, so it's,  you know, it's a little bit weird for my company.  It's not like the acceptability comes a little bit late.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I do understand your point of view.  But it's OK, nobody's.  OK, thank you so much, I really appreciate the time  which you have given to me.  You have really come to me.  Not everyone has been.  Thank you so much.  When I say it, please take care, sir.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello, Eric.  This is Jason.  I'm calling on behalf of AWS, Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we're not really interested, but thank you.
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: I'm not here to sell you anything, Eric, and I'm not calling in regards to, you know,  about your Amazon Web Services. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: Well, if you may allow to explain the reason I'm calling.  Is that alright?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I really don't have a lot of time, so if you can make it quick, I really don't think it applies, but can you summarize?
 SPEAKER_00: Alright, sure.  So, Eric, the reason actually I'm calling is because AWS wanted to share an opportunity with you in regards to generative AI.  Have you ever thought about implementing artificial intelligence technology in your current work frame?
 SPEAKER_01: For what reason?
 SPEAKER_00: Well, because you know-
 SPEAKER_01: What purpose?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so the benefit of implementing artificial intelligence in your work frame could help you improve operational efficiency and speed to market.  Many of the businesses have seen significant benefits from implementing AI solutions, and that is the only reason AWS is offering a free one-hour consultation with an AI expert, you know, which could help you leverage cutting-edge AI technology to grow your business.  So, would you be interested in learning how large language models and generative AI can benefit your specific business needs?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I'm not really interested in that, but I appreciate your call.
 SPEAKER_00: Specific reason, Eric?
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: I just- you know, we're kind of, you know, just about handling all the business we can right now, and we don't really have time to investigate that at this point, at some point in the future maybe, but not right now.  Okay? Unknown Speaker: Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: Nope.  I gotta go.  That's fine.  Thanks.

 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, that's not my role.  But yeah.  So unfortunately, a lot of people  are doing what they try to or are hand-in-hand,  one-to-one, real small group.  So I'm not doing math sales.  It wouldn't be a problem for that.  But I appreciate you reaching out.  And I think you guys have a great product.
 SPEAKER_00: So I completely agree with what you're saying.  Sorry.  I apologize to Carti Shark.  Scott, I agree what you're saying.  But as generative AI is like, as per our understanding,  you will be the end users.  I see, because when you're working on sales,  you can actually use generative AI  to analyze the effectiveness of sales campaign,  providing personalized, close-plan  tailored to your customer and sales profit.  It can also increase conversion rates  by offering step-by-step guidance with milestones  grounded in CRM data.  So right now, I am not looking for someone  who can implement it.  I'm looking for someone who wants to implement it.  So basically, you're not going to interrupt it.
 SPEAKER_01: But I just have a little foretime there.  It's not going to be a hit for us, because we don't do campaign.  We don't do that outreach before.  It's a hard scale.  But I hope people love it again.  It's a really nice talk to you.  I've explored this before with AWS, which is not fair.  No problem.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you for your time.  Bye-bye.

 SPEAKER_00: Mr. India, good morning. Hi, how are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, I'm good. How are you?
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, yes, I'm good too. Thank you so much for asking.  Mr. India, the reason I call is that you are the Florida Operations Vice President and Director, right?  With Glee Associates.  Yes.  Okay.  So that is the reason. Yes, yes. So that is the reason I am calling you today because  we have noticed your business has been using AWS services and I just wanted to understand,  have you ever thought of implementing AI or have you ever tried using AI in your day-to-day operations?
 SPEAKER_01: Any incorporation of AI would be done through our corporate office, which is in Tampa,  and the key person to talk to would be Doug Roberts.
 SPEAKER_00: So James, I talked to you understand, but let me also tell you, I'm not asking you to make any decisions,  and I'm not asking you to make any changes. I'm just calling you because I'm just calling to let you know that we are offering  one-hour free consultation with AI experts because many businesses have significant benefits from implementing AI solutions,  and it can help you improve operational efficiency and speed to market.  So I just wanted to share you the details on your email. You can go through it, and then if you are interested,  we can go ahead and schedule the consultation, one-hour free consultation, according to your convenient time.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: Again, well, if you would want to reach out to our Tampa office or IT point of contact, which is Doug Roberts,  anything that we incorporate with AI would be done through Doug Roberts. Not me.  So you could send it to me, but the person you would want to reach out to is Doug Roberts.
 SPEAKER_00: Sure. The final decision will be done by Doug Roberts, right?
 SPEAKER_01: No, you don't need to send it to me. I wouldn't be looking at it. He would be the one that evaluates, not me.
 SPEAKER_00: All right, no problem then.  Thank you.  Thank you. Bye-bye.

 SPEAKER_01: Good afternoon, Cecily.  My name is Sam and I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?  Doing well.  How are you?  I'm doing fine.  Thank you so much.  So Cecily, I believe you are a director of marketing with Clark Parsington, correct?  That is correct.  Yeah, actually we have noticed that your business has been already using Amazon Web Services  and we just wanted to share a free consultation offer that could help you to leverage cutting-edge  AI technology to grow your business.  So are you currently using Generative AI for your side of business?
 SPEAKER_00: We are not.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, so actually we are offering a free consultation with an AI expert who can help you in learning  how large language models and Generative AI can benefit your specific business needs.  And you can understand your current use case and business goals and you can explore industry-specific  AI applications.  And in this consultation, you can ask any relevant questions like how AI can help you  to implement in your business.  So we will share all these details with you over your email so that you can go through  it and one of our experts will reach out to you and he will schedule this consultation.  So is that fine?
 SPEAKER_00: Now you said you are with Amazon?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so is that separate from Amazon.com?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, we are a marketing digital consultancy and Amazon has hired us for these projects.
 SPEAKER_00: Gotcha.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  So would you like to schedule this consultation?
 SPEAKER_00: Not at this time, but I appreciate the opportunity.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, so may I know the reason for that?  For a feedback?
 SPEAKER_00: Budgeting.
 SPEAKER_01: Oh, so actually this is a free consultation so you don't have to pay anything or anything like that.
 SPEAKER_00: No, that's okay, I understand, but eventually you're trying to sell services, right?
 SPEAKER_01: No, no, no, I'm not trying to sell you anything.  Your company has been already using Amazon Web Services and we are just offering a free  consultation to upgrade you with AI technology.  That's the only purpose.
 SPEAKER_00: So what kind of web services are we using with Amazon?
 SPEAKER_01: So someone from your company would be using Amazon Web Services, Cloud Services.  So that's the reason why we are reaching out to you so that we are introducing this AI technology to you.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, I got you.  Well, not interested at this time, but I'll do a little research and I can maybe give you a call back if it turns out it looks like something we could use.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, sure then, no problem.  Thank you so much.
 SPEAKER_00: How could I best reach you?
 SPEAKER_01: So actually this is company's number, so you won't be able to reach me on this number.  So for that you have to reach to the Amazon's email services, which your company would be already having.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, all right.  Thank you very much.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, thank you so much.  Have a nice day.  You too.

 SPEAKER_01: What do you need?
 SPEAKER_00: Actually, we have noticed your business has been using AWS for quite some time,  and we are offering a one-hour free compensation offer that could help you leverage cutting HAI.  So I just wanted to understand, have you ever thought of implementing Gen AI,  or have you ever tried using Gen AI for your...
 SPEAKER_01: It's all getting done at a corporate level.  It's all getting done by...  So on the CMO of Colorado Living, there's also Sage Home that acquired it last year,  and the CMO of Sage Home and stuff is doing all that stuff.  On the CMO of a business, it's owned by somebody else.  That's who you need to be talking to.  It's Sage Home.  Just Google Sage Home.  You can call them.  Sage.  Stay on us.  Sage, S-A-G-E.
 SPEAKER_00: And who would be the right person here?
 SPEAKER_01: Oh, I can't give that information out.  You could call in and try to see if you can get in touch with somebody or what have you,  but yeah, I can't give out my C...  My chief marketing officer, Sage's personal number.  You can call them, though.
 SPEAKER_00: Mr. Paliso, can I also let you know that actually I'm calling the coast.  We would like to offer a one-hour free discussion or consultation with AI experts  regarding how it can improve operational efficiency and speed to market.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I can't all that stuff, but I'm not the person...  I wouldn't go to that session or what have you.  That's not my job.
 SPEAKER_00: All right, no problem then.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, try to call Sage Home so you can get somebody in there,  but I'm sure that our VP of administration handles IT and handles AWS and stuff like that.  It's probably very aware of what you're going over.
 SPEAKER_00: No problem then.  Have a good day.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hello?  Hey, hi Charles.  My name is Kevin and I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you doing today?
 Speaker SPEAKER_01: This is from where? Unknown Speaker: 
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services. Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Speaker Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, yeah I haven't, I don't think I've ordered anything.
 SPEAKER_00: No, no, I'm not here to save you anything or it's not just for a service call.  Actually the reason of my call is that we have noticed that your business has been using some of Amazon AWS services.  So we wanted to share a free consultation offer that could help you leverage and rate the AI technology to grow your business.  So I believe you're the CEO with Gamalon, is that correct?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't know anything about the technical side of things.  So I appreciate the call but there's some, and in fact I'm not even sure we're still using the services or we'll be using the services.  A partner of mine has split off is probably the individual that was using them.  So yeah, okay, but I appreciate the call.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so the reason actually what I was doing here is we have noticed that you have been actively using AWS services.  So we are just offering a free consultation.
 SPEAKER_01: No, no, what I'm trying to explain and I'm going to get off the phone, okay, is number one, I don't know anything about it so you're talking to the wrong person.  Number two, I think the reason you're showing that is we may be paying for something that my partner is using but he's no longer working with us.  Okay, it's part of the deal, an exit deal.  Okay, so that's why it's complicated but I appreciate your calling, right?
 SPEAKER_00: I appreciate your time. You have a good day.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello, this is George.
 SPEAKER_00: Hey George, this is Phoebe and I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: George, I believe you are the president at Landcare Owners and Buildings.  Our organization, is that correct?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, it is.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  So George, the reason behind my call today is that we have noticed the business has been using AWS services.  So I just had a limited time complimentary opportunity on leveraging generative AI to, you know, grow your day-to-day process in the business.  So like, have you ever thought on implementing generative AI through your day-to-day processes?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm having a hard time understanding you.  Could you shoot me an email with what you're wanting to talk to me about?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, for sure George.  Although it will just take a few seconds for me if I can explain it to you.  It is about generative AI and basically right now we are offering an hour free consultation with an AI expert about how generative AI can ease out your day-to-day processes.  Like, you know, strategic planning and decision-making, operational efficiency, business development.  And for that we are offering an hour free consultation.  So what I can do is I can like, inform your email and I can schedule that consultation for you.  And in upcoming days our partner will contact you and according to your convenience and availability you can further schedule it, okay?
 SPEAKER_01: Well, I think we are, I'm the president of the Lancer Owners and Builders Organization.  We're a nonprofit. We don't manufacture anything. We don't have any employees.  We're just a support club for our members, the people that fly a certain kind of airplane.  So I think we have a business.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's okay George. This is actually a complimentary opportunity.  And it's just an hour free consultation with an AI expert and it is going to be very informative and also it can be scheduled according to your preference.  So you don't have to worry about this, you know, making decision or whatsoever.  You can just be on the call, have the information and if you like what you hear and see, then only you can take it forward or you can just stop out.
 SPEAKER_01: I don't think I'm interested. We don't deal with any AI. It doesn't sound like it's anything that this club would be interested in.

 SPEAKER_01: Hi, I believe I'm speaking with Rogelio.  Rogelio Amaya, right?
 SPEAKER_00: Rogelio Amaya, I think I heard you.
 SPEAKER_01: Hi, I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  My name is Frey.  How are you doing today?  Good, thanks. How are you?  I'm doing great.  Thank you for asking.  Well, Rogelio, I wanted to reach out to you because I believe you're the president of CMA Technologies, right?
 SPEAKER_00: What can I do for you, buddy?
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, well, we observed your company has been using AWS Services,  and we wanted to offer you a free one-hour consultation, interactive consultation with an AI professional  who can assist you how to utilize cutting-edge AI technologies to not only to expand your business,  but also to increase productivity in your workflow.  Basically, this conversation can help you to improve the operational efficiency and speed up to market.  Like many businesses have seen significant benefits from implementing AI solutions, and you also can...
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, no, we are managing business.  We are a big provider.  So we get people that do this for us internally or look out for another services.  But at the moment, we don't have that need.  I'm sorry, I haven't...  Somebody has another line, and I need to get to my client.  But yeah, we don't need these services at the moment.  Thanks.
 SPEAKER_01: Well, Rogelio, I guess you misunderstood me.  I'm not here to sell you anything, or to ask for any services.  The only reason I wanted to reach out to you is to give you a platform where you can learn about AI  and how you can leverage that AI technology for your expansion of your business.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, I don't think there's...  I got to get back to my customer, my friend, but I don't think we have any previous service at the moment.  Maybe check back in another few months, about five months or so?
 SPEAKER_01: Sure, I'll make sure of it.  But thank you so much for your time. Have a nice day ahead.

 SPEAKER_00: Hey Jennifer, this is Strah. I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services. How are you?  I'm calling from Amazon Web Services.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services and the reason I wanted to reach out to you is because I believe you're the director of sales and marketing.
 SPEAKER_01: I don't have time for any outside scheduled calls at this moment.  That's why I've unfortunately had to put people to voicemail.  So if you can, you can try back another time, but we're not looking to actually put our company name into anything outside of our current standards.
 Speaker SPEAKER_00: Sure, sure. I'll try later.  But I can assure you that my intention was not to sell you any service or product or something like that.  The only reason I wanted to reach out to you is to... Unknown Speaker: No, I understand.
 SPEAKER_00: Fine. So can you help me understand when is the right time to reach out to you?
 SPEAKER_01: Are you looking for a reach out and use your platform?
 SPEAKER_00: No, the reason I wanted to reach out to you is because I've seen your company have been using AWS for quite a long time.  And we wanted to offer you, you've been the director of sales and marketing.  We wanted to offer you a free one-hour consultation with the one for AI experts who can help you to understand how you can utilize cutting-edge AI technology in order to export.
 SPEAKER_01: We're not interested in that.  We're not interested at this time.  Well, there's an interesting reason.
 SPEAKER_00: I mean, you...
 SPEAKER_01: Again, you've called me three times and I've put your number to voicemail.  I don't have time for an unscheduled call at this moment, so you can try back again.  But at this moment, we're not looking to move outside of what we're currently using, but I do appreciate that as a call.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you so much.  Thank you so much.  I really appreciate that, Jeff.

 SPEAKER_01: Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, this is Mark.  I'm calling on behalf of AWS Amazon Web Services.  Hello, this is how are you Wes?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm doing fine.

So Wes, we had noticed that your business has been using the AWS services oftenly.  So we wanted to share a free consultation offer that could help you to leverage edge-cutting  AI technology to grow your business.  So, Wes, have you ever thought of integrating or implementing generative AI into your day-to-day  business?
 SPEAKER_01: No, sir.  No, we don't do that.  We're not really that advanced over here.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so are you interested in learning how large language models or generative AI can  benefit your day-to-day business needs?
 SPEAKER_01: I said it again.
 SPEAKER_00: Are you interested in learning how large language models or generative AI can benefit your specific  business needs?
 SPEAKER_01: Oh, no, not right now.  I really wouldn't, not right now, but maybe later, you know.  You know, right now we're just not ready for that.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so that's the reason why I call.  We are offering a one-hour consultation with AI expert to help you on this, how you can  integrate generative AI into a day-to-day business.  That's the reason why I call.  Yeah, okay.  Well, now I sure appreciate you calling me.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I appreciate you calling me about that, but, you know, I guess if we come up with that  later, you know, we can discuss it.  I appreciate it.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay.  So should I give a call back to you after one or two days?
 SPEAKER_01: Well, you know, it's going to be, it would be a while, you know, before I'd be thinking  about that.  I'm thinking, you know, maybe a year, you know, when we come around thinking like that.  I appreciate it.  Okay, no problem.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, sure, I understand that.  Yeah, it's very nice to talk to you.  Bye-bye.

And Greg, the reason I'm calling you, because we have noticed that your organization has an active user of AWS services,  and I'm reaching out to you today because we have a very stimulating opportunity that I think would really benefit your business.
 SPEAKER_01: Now, with that being said, I think we are...  I'm calling from Dallas, Texas for this.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, this has nothing to do with the business owner and all of that, sir. I'm reaching out, like I said, to offer you a very limited offer from the AWS.  That's the one hour free consultation with our AII expert.
 SPEAKER_01: No, Dan, that's going to have to be handled by the IT department with the company, so...
 SPEAKER_00: I do understand, sir. I do understand, but if I'm not mistaken, you are the vice president, right?  Delete and write animal morality as the velocity program manager?
 SPEAKER_01: No.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. So this program, which I'm talking about, it's not for the entire organization or with the related department to the IT and all.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay. All right. All right. No, thank you. Appreciate it.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Yes, hello.  Good morning.  Am I speaking to Robert?  Yes, he is.  Hello, Robert.  My name is Joseph and I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you doing?  Fine.  That's all good.  Thank you so much for asking, Robert.  Robert, the purpose of my call to you today is that we've noticed that your business has been using AWS.  So you've come in today with a limited time offer of a one hour free consultation about AI, from our AI experts,  and also wanted to know about your thoughts on implementing AI technology on your business.

That's actually great to hear.  So as you're already aware about the workings, how about I schedule this consultation and somebody from our partner team will reach out to you.  Oh, thanks.  Maybe you can, you know, address us.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Good afternoon, sales department.  This is Geraldine.  How may I help you?
 SPEAKER_00: Right.  This is Ms. Geraldine Schmidt, director of sales and marketing.
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, that is correct.  This is Geraldine.  How may I help you today?
 SPEAKER_00: Yes, Ms. Schmidt.  Good afternoon.  My name is Grace, and then I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Wait Services,  AWE, with Hawaii today.
 SPEAKER_01: I'm doing fantastic.  I'm sorry, Amazon Wait Services?
 SPEAKER_00: Yes, WAVEB Wait Services.  And Ashley, do you want me to repeat that?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, I'm sorry.  What is your name?
 SPEAKER_00: My name is Grace.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Wait Services, AWS.  Okay.  Sure.  So the reason, yes, the reason I called today is that as you are the director of sales  and marketing with all girls, Algeria, LLC,  Amazon Wait Services would like to discuss an amazing opportunity with you  because we have noticed your business has been using AWS services.  And I just wanted to understand here, Geraldine,  have you ever thought of implementing Generative AI  or have you ever tried using Generative AI in your business of sales and marketing?
 SPEAKER_01: What type of service is this?
 SPEAKER_00: It's Generative AI.
 SPEAKER_01: Generative AI.
 SPEAKER_00: Do you have a Generative AI?  A Deficial Intelligence, sorry.
 SPEAKER_01: No, I know what that is, but how would I be?  How would you...  I'm not sure what you're looking for me to do.  I mean, we have AI, but what are you looking for me to do with AI?
 SPEAKER_00: So actually the reason I call this that we are offering a free consultation offer  which could help leverage cutting-edge AI to grow your business  and help improve operational efficiency and spirit to market  because we have also seen many significant benefits from businesses implementing AI solutions.  So would you be interested in this free consultation offer?
 SPEAKER_01: You know what? We're not interested at this time.  I'm so sorry.  Yeah, but no, so we wouldn't be interested in this service at this time.  So I do apologize, but I think we're okay for now.  We do have an office that handles all of this  and so it's really not me that you would want to speak with about this.  We're part of a very large company.  So if we are looking to move forward with AI, you know, as far as in sales and marketing,  we would research that further, but that is something that I wouldn't be handling.
 SPEAKER_00: I totally understand that.  Also, can I also add that I'm not asking you to make any changes right away.  Like I said, we are offering this consultation and if you're interested,  you can go ahead and schedule it according to your convenience time.  And there is no obligation.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, it's just not, I'm not the right person you should be speaking to regarding AI.  So, you know, I do apologize for that and the people who would be handling the AI,  they would be researching that themselves.  So I do apologize, but it's not something I'd be interested in as far as a consultant right now, okay?  I do appreciate the call though. Thank you so much.  No problem. All right, you have a good day Ben.  You have a wonderful day. Bye now.  You too.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Brontine, this is Vanya.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  Hi.  This is Ms. Yelaross, right?  Vanya Yelaross.  That is right.  Okay.  Good afternoon.  My name is Grace.  I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services, AWS.  How are you?  Good.  How are you?  Oh, yes.  I'm good too.  Thank you so much for asking.  And actually, the reason I call is that you are one of the partner, right, with Brontine LLC.
 SPEAKER_00: That is correct.
 SPEAKER_01: So, yes, that is why I'm calling you today because Amazon Web Services would like to discuss an exciting opportunity with you.  We don't.
 SPEAKER_00: First, I want to interrupt you by that because I'm not going to waste your time.  I am a partner here.  I'm not a decision maker.  Nothing depends on me or what will be purchased.  So, yeah, you're calling the wrong person.  I'm sorry.  And I can't, I appreciate your call, but I don't know who's the right person.  I mean, you can talk to other partners that are on our website, but yeah, it's not me.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you so much.  I'm not asking you to make any purchase here.
 SPEAKER_00: But I really don't even want to listen because I don't want to be listening.  They are making the communication to someone else that will make the decision and so forth.  We don't use any Web Services.  So, I don't even know if whatever you're offering would be any applicable.  We have those phone right now.
 SPEAKER_01: You have a good day.
 SPEAKER_00: You too.  Bye-bye.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out. Unknown Speaker: Hello.
 SPEAKER_00: Hi, I'm asking with Sean.  Sean Nick.  Hi Sean, this is Shrey.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you? Unknown Speaker: I'm good. Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker:  Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: Pretty good.  That's wonderful to know.  Great, great.  Well, the reason I wanted to reach out to you, because I believe you are the director of IT at HeroBillion, right?  Yes.  Great, great.  Well, the reason, like I said, the reason I wanted to reach out to you is because we have been observing that your company has been using AWS services.  Okay, and we wanted to offer you a free one-hour consultation with an AI professional to assist you where you can understand how you can utilize cutting-edge AI technologies to expand your business and also to bring a job in your workflow.  Basically, this consultation can help you to improve the operational efficiency and speed up the market.  So, I already have your email address, which is Sean at HeroBillion.com, right?
 SPEAKER_01: That's correct, yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, great.  So, I can simply go ahead and register it to you and you will receive an email from Mission Control and you can schedule it as per your convenience.
 SPEAKER_01: So, I'm good to you.  So, you're just saying that you're offering an hour consult in general? Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: Basically, go ahead.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, so like I said, you will be having an interactive consultation with an AI expert where he will be guiding you how you can use AI not only to expand your business but also in your workflow as well, especially when you being, you know, director of IT, you understand that, right?  So, that's what the whole interactive consultation would be.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, I may take you up on it, so is this focused on AI?  Is that kind of the focus?  Yes.  Okay.  Yes.  I'm unlikely to take you up on it just because I just have other priorities right now. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  AI, although I see some potential, like it's just really not, like certain businesses just aren't in the position where they're ready to take on AI stuff.  I mean, we're taking advantage of the AI stuff, but like what you're talking about using AWS infrastructure to take on, we're just not really ready for that right now.  Maybe I would be ready for that in like six months or in a year or something like that.
 SPEAKER_00: Absolutely fine, Sean.  Absolutely fine.  But that's exactly the reason I wanted to reach out to you.  So you will have an education or understanding of AI in your field when the time arises, you will have knowledge and you will have something to offer for your organization as well.  Okay.  And that's what the whole purpose of my call where you will be not only to reach out to you, but to educate you, the importance of AI, how it's going to, you know, a lot of companies have gone ahead and applied AI and their solutions have been employed with AI and have found magnificent results. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: And it's not only about, you know, about only expanding the business.  It's also about your day-to-day workflow as well, how you can take advantage of AI for to make that whole process more agile.  Okay.  So you can simply go ahead and like I said, you can attend as per your convenience.  Okay.  It's not like necessarily you will be have to attend it today or tomorrow.  It will be like within the next two weeks.  And again, like I said, you will receive an email from Mission Control and it will have an document which will give you a company's spectrum what we are talking about.  And you can schedule it as per your convenience.
 SPEAKER_01: All right.  You can send me an email.  That's fine.  I'm not sure if I'll attend or sign up, but you can send me an email.  That would be great.
 SPEAKER_00: All right.  Okay.  Wonderful.  Wonderful.  Yeah.  So I just want to confirm your email.  I believe it's Sean at herobillion.com, right? Unknown Speaker: Yep.
 SPEAKER_00: Great.  Great.  And you are the director of IT at Hero Billion, right?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.  Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Great.  Well, thank you, Sean.  Would you like AWS to share your contact information, title, company and details of this project with Mission Cloud so that they may contact you by email, post or phone to assist you.  In addition to your name, email address and phone number, Mission Cloud will be provided with the project title, project description, project revenue estimates to AWS and the project timeline.  All right.
 SPEAKER_01: Well, crap.  So now you think this is not AWS itself.  It's another organization that you're handing me off to and you're sharing my data with.  You guys are correct?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  So like I said, Mission Cloud will send you an email.  Okay.  And they will send you a document also that how a generative AI is implemented and then you can schedule it with the AWS as well.
 SPEAKER_01: Right.  I got it.  So, but it's another organization. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: I don't know.  Like to be honest with you, I'm not really that into this.  Right now.  It's not.  Not for me.  I'm actually, you know, sorry to waste your time, but I'm good.  I don't need to talk in no words.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm not sure.  No words, but thank you so much for your valuable time.  Please take care of yourself.  Have a nice day.

 SPEAKER_01: Want to reach to Daniel Rakhtin?
 SPEAKER_00: Thanks.  Connecting you now.  Hello.
 SPEAKER_01: Hi.  I'm asking Daniel, Daniel Rakhtin.  Yes, who's speaking?  Hi, Daniel.  This is Shrey.  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?  I'm doing great.  That's wonderful to know.  Daniel, I wanted to reach out to you because I believe you are the vice president of finance  at Advinium, right?
 SPEAKER_00: Huh?
 SPEAKER_01: You are the vice president of finance at Advinium.  I'm a vice person, you said?  Yeah.  You are the VP of finance at Advinium.  Oh, vice president, yes.  How can I help you?  Great.  Well, like I said, the reason I wanted to reach out to you because we observed your company  has been using AWS services and we wanted to offer you a free one-hour consultation with  AI professional to assist you where you can understand how you can utilize cutting edge  AI technologies to make the whole operational efficiency regarding your finance and accounting  and other things as well to bring industry to the market.  I'm not involved in using AWS in my company so I would not be the right person.  I understand, Daniel.  But the intention over here is not to reach out to someone who is using AWS.  My purpose over here is to help you to understand how AI, how generative AI can help you to  make the whole workflow of finance more agile and how you can leverage that.  No, this is not in my opinion.  I'm not interested.  Thank you.  What is that in specific reason, Daniel?  Because this has nothing to do with my job.  You are into finance, right?  Yes, I am.  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: Hello Alex speaking.
 SPEAKER_00: Hey, am I talking to Ankud Sarkar at ASC Americans on Components?
 SPEAKER_01: With who, sorry?
 SPEAKER_00: Ankud Sarkar.
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, speaking.
 SPEAKER_00: Hey Ankud, this is Sivi and I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Good, thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so Ankud I believe you are the director of sales over there, is that correct?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, correct.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so the reason behind my call today Ankud is that we have noticed your business has been using AWS services  and I just wanted to share a limited time complimentary opportunity, you know, on leveraging generative AI to grow your business.  Have you ever given it a thought of implementing generative AI to your day to day operations?
 SPEAKER_01: Well, we use different things but we're not actually using AWS.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, well, like have you ever thought on implementing generative AI?  Because if you're interested in knowing like how it can help you, there are a lot of ways like sales and strategy planning, lead generation and management, sales process optimization.  So we are basically if you're interested in knowing about it more, we are offering an hour free consultation with an AI expert and you can schedule it according to your preference.  And if it is not a sales call, it will not be an any obligation to make any decision, you can schedule it according to your preference.  So like would that be okay for you to schedule that consultation?
 SPEAKER_01: Well, I just think that this is probably would be very relevant to us.  Sorry?  You know, we use a lot of it probably won't be very relevant to us at the moment because of a new solution that we've already implemented where we've just basically gone and launched a new website.  So within this website, we have implemented the process for being able to manage this sort of thing with a regenerative AI and it links with our partners and stuff.  So yeah, it's probably not very relevant across the stage.
 SPEAKER_00: Got it.  So uncle, what I'm trying to say is that you don't have to implement anything.  It's very informative the consultation that will happen and you can just be on the call and you know, you can just hear all of that.  If you like that, then only you can move forward.  You can just drop out if you don't.  It will not be any obligation.
 SPEAKER_01: What I'm saying is it's just, it's just, I just saying it's there'll be there's no point in discussing the meeting.  I know we definitely might be doing it.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay. So if you don't want to, you can basically schedule it according to your preference and time and I can send you an email to if you're not okay with the meeting.
 SPEAKER_01: No, as I said, sorry, it's just not very relevant to us at this stage.  It was just not something we need.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay. Okay.  Thank you uncle.  Thank you so much for your hand.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you.  Bye bye.

 SPEAKER_00: I'm good.  Thank you so much.  So I believe you are a director with KRC, correct?  KRC Logistics?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm the director of sales with KRC Logistics.  How can I help you?
 SPEAKER_00: Yes, actually we have noticed that your business has been already using AWS services and we  wanted to share a free consultation offer that could help you to leverage cutting edge  AI technology to grow your business.  So are you currently using AI technology in your side of business?
 SPEAKER_01: No, we are not.  But I can transfer you over to our IT department because they would have jurisdiction over that.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, no, actually we are reaching out to you because you are a sales director and actually this is not  something technical or anything like that and you don't have to make any decision.  This is just a consultation with AI expert to help you to understand your current use case  and business goals and you can explore industry specific AI applications.  And this consultation can help you to improve operational efficiency and speak to the market.  So that's the reason why we are reaching out to you.  So would you like to register your interest for this consultation?
 SPEAKER_01: No, thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, may I know the reason for that?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I'm just not interested.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay, no problem.  Thank you, have a nice day.
 SPEAKER_01: You too, thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: I'm doing fine.  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Great.  I won't take much of your time.  Maria, I believe I'm talking to a partner with – you are a partner with GWW.
 SPEAKER_01: I am part of the –  I don't have any decision-making power at all.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, okay.  Well, Maria, I am not here to ask you to make any decision.  The only reason actually I was calling is because AWS wanted to share an exciting opportunity specifically designed for businesses like yours at the leadership level.  We have identified that your company is actually utilizing AWS services, and that is why AWS wanted to offer you a complimentary consultation to explore the benefit of cutting-edge AI solution tailored to your business needs.  So I'm sure you would be interested in discovering how advanced generative AI models can enhance your business operations and drive growth in your industry.  So are you open to scheduling this complimentary consultation session with AI experts?
 SPEAKER_01: No.  AI is something that we do.  So no, that would not be anything that we would be interested in.  And like I said, I don't have any decision-making, so you wouldn't be talking to me because I couldn't talk about the business or give you any information.  So no, thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: No worries, Maria.  Thank you so much for your time.  You have a great day.
 SPEAKER_01: You too.  You take care.  Bye-bye. Unknown Speaker: Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: Hi, Vicky.  Good morning.  My name is Cheyenne.  I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  I hope you're doing well.
 SPEAKER_00: Oh, yeah.  I'm good.
 SPEAKER_01: All right.  Great.  And Vicky, well, I believe that you are the finance director at Port Crange Logistics,  right?  I am.  All right.  Wonderful.  So, as we are profiling today, Amazon Web Services would like you to discuss an exciting opportunity  for small and medium-sized businesses like yours to explore generative AI solutions, that  is, artificial individual solutions.  And we have noticed that your company has been using Amazon Web Services for quite a  long time.  So, Vicky, have you ever thought or have you tried to implement generative AI into your  operations in the finance department, maybe in your operations?  Yeah.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  We use AI for our accounting here.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  Great.  That's wonderful.  So, well, Vicky, I believe that you must be using AI, but maybe not in the large extent,  but maybe in smaller crown.  So, what I can do is that today, Amazon Web Services are also offering a free one-hour  cancellation with AI expert.  I can also share this free cancellation offer that could help your leverage, getting AI  technology to grow your businesses.  And I have an email address as Vicky thought Oliver is at Port CrangeLogistics.com.  Would that be the best email address to share the info?
 SPEAKER_00: We're really good.  We integrate with our financial software, and so we just go through what they recommend.  So, I'm good.  I'm really not too interested right now.
 SPEAKER_01: All right.  I just want to let you know.  Yeah.  Sorry.  If you can give me...  Yeah.  Sorry, go ahead.
 SPEAKER_00: I was just going to say, but thank you anyway.
 SPEAKER_01: No problem.  Yeah.  Thank you so much, Vicky.  Then it was a pleasure speaking with you.  You have a lovely day, Ed.  Enjoy the day.  You too.  Bye.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello, good afternoon.  Hello, my name is Joseph and I am calling NBF of Amazon Web Services.  I am doing good. Thank you so much for asking. Larry, we have noticed that your business has been using AWS.  I just wanted to share a limited time one hour free consultation about AI technology.  Apart from that, I also wanted to know about your thoughts on implementing the AI technology on your business.
 SPEAKER_01: I would have to talk with our development team to see if they want to do that.
 SPEAKER_00: I appreciate that you are showing interest on it.  The thing is, based on your availability, you can actually watch this consultation, one hour consultation.  Once you get to know some idea as to what it has to provide or how you can integrate it into your business,  later on we can come up to a decision. How does that sound to you?
 SPEAKER_01: Sure. This would be like a video overview.
 SPEAKER_00: Yes, we have a certified Amazon partner and they would contact you via mail or phone just like us.  Once you are into the consultation, you will be speaking with AI experts.  They will give you ideas as to how you can integrate AI into your business.
 SPEAKER_01: If I move forward, then you will have somebody contact me?  Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: A partner?  Yes, a partner.
 SPEAKER_01: I will tell you what, I am just going to pass for right now.  We just contracted with a software development firm to rewrite our software.  The whole planning and everything around that is we are relying on their expertise.  I will still give it some thought, but for right now I don't think it is going to be helpful.  If you want to follow up in maybe 30 days, that would probably work.
 SPEAKER_00: I totally agree with you, but the thing is this is a limited time offer.  I am not going to do it.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out. Unknown Speaker: Hello.
 SPEAKER_00: Hi, I'm speaking with Satish.  Satish now.  Speaking of this, yeah.  Satish my name is Akil, Akil Sharma.  I'm calling you on behalf of AWS, Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Fine, thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Great.  We'll have to talk for a couple of minutes.
 SPEAKER_01: What is it we're getting?
 SPEAKER_00: So Satish, the reason I'm calling you,  because we see that you're currently working  as the head of operation at Mekha's incarnation.  Right?  Now, just wanted to check, have you ever thought  of implementing generative AI to your day-to-day operations?
 SPEAKER_01: No, not yet.  I'm not the right person to take the decisions.
 SPEAKER_00: No, I mean, like I'm not looking for someone  who can take the decision.  The reason I'm contacting you is because you're  head of operations.  So even in operations, like there are certain part  of your operation where you can actually utilize generative  AI to improve your operational efficiency and all.  So that's the reason I'm just calling you,  because your company has been using our services  for quite a long time now.
 SPEAKER_01: Right?  What services are we using?  I'm not sure.
 SPEAKER_00: For AWS, Amazon Web Services, I'm not sure which product  you are using, but we kind of noticed  that there is some part of our services has been used.
 SPEAKER_01: I'm not sure about it.  Okay, go ahead.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  So, see, I'm not calling you to make a decision right now.  We are just scheduling a one-hour consultation  with one of our AI experts who can help you to understand  how you can leverage generative AI to your day-to-day operation  as a user, not as someone who you don't need to have  to have a technical knowledge about it.  As a user, how you can use it and what it can help you  to improve operational efficiency on a day-to-day basis.  So if you think that post having that consultation,  if you think that it is useful, then we can take it from there  when it comes to implementation part.
 SPEAKER_01: I don't think we use much of AI right now. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_01: I think that's very minimal operations I do.  So, it will not be necessary for me at this moment.  In case in future if anything is still just stopping an email,  I will call you back.
 SPEAKER_00: No problem, Satish.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Bye-bye.

 SPEAKER_00: So, those things are handled by our CEO,  and like I said, I know that he is not interested in those things.  So, I'm sorry, but, yeah,  I can't make an appointment with you because I already know.  We get several marketing calls a day,  so I already know what his expectation is.  So, I appreciate it, but we're not interested.
 SPEAKER_01: No, it's just...  Cheryl, thank you so much for your time.  Have a great day.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you, YouTube. Bye-bye.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello.  Good morning.  I believe this is Mr. Russell.  Adam Russell.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, speaking.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  Adam, hi.  Good morning to you.  This is Grace.  My name is Grace and then I'm calling on behalf of AWS Amazon Web Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Good. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  Good to have that.  And actually the reason I call you today is that you are the vice, sorry, co-founder,  right, with Group RFV.
 SPEAKER_01: Yes.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  So that is the reason I'm calling you today because Amazon Web Services would like to  discuss an exciting opportunity with you for small and medium businesses like yours.  So I wanted to understand, have you ever thought of implementing Generative AI or have you ever  thought of using, I mean, have you ever tried using JNAI in your day-to-day daily operations  business?
 SPEAKER_01: No, not really.  But you know what?  This is probably better suited for my partner because he's more of the operations person.
 SPEAKER_00: So let me...  Well, actually...
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah.
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  Can I quickly let you know, Adam, we...  I'm calling you because we wanted to share a limited time offer that could help you leverage  AI to grow your business.  And we are offering this program that creates the best practice generative AI foundation  with all the tools needed to quickly integrate AI into your business.  So would you like me to go ahead and...  No.
 SPEAKER_01: No, I'm okay.  Thank you.  And I apologize, but I do have to run.  I have a 10 o'clock call, and that's only four minutes away that I've got to prep for.  But thank you for the call.
 SPEAKER_00: No problem.  Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: Yes, sir.  Hi, is this Jesse Williams?  Yes, it is.  Hi, I'm so William. This is Jason. I'm calling on behalf of AWS, Amazon Web Services. How are you?
 SPEAKER_02: Amazon Web Services?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, Amazon Web Services, AWS.  Uh-huh.  All right. I won't take much of your time. I believe I'm talking to a general manager with the Riviera Enterprises. Is that right?
 SPEAKER_02: Yes, with the reports we'll manage.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, absolutely. So the reason actually, you know, I was calling you today, Mr. Williams, is because AWS wanted to share an exciting opportunity, specifically designed for the businesses like yours.  At the leadership level, we have identified that your company is utilizing AWS services and AWS wanted to offer you a complimentary consultation to explore the benefits of cutting AI solutions tailored to your business needs.  So Mr. Williams, have you ever thought of implementing AI, Generative AI in your current day to day work operations?
 SPEAKER_02: We are using AI soar now.
 SPEAKER_01: Oh, that's wonderful. So you must be aware that how powerful AI is and how it could help you. It could help you in, you know, automating routine tasks, data-driven decision-making, performance monitoring, resource allocation, and risk management, enhanced communication, customer insight, and strategic planning.  So that is the reason AWS have, you know, arranged, wanted to schedule one-hour free consultation with you so that you can, you know, identify how it can help you to discover advanced generative AI model, can enhance your business operations, and drive growth in your industry.  So would you be interested in scheduling this one-hour AI consultation with an AI exposure?
 SPEAKER_02: Not at the time, sir, because right now we're going through trying to get this AI with the soar and everything, and right now we would just want to hold off on everything until we finish getting this together.  So you can call me back at a later date or so right now. I wouldn't be interested in it, okay?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, Mr. Williams, see, the reason I'm calling you is because the consultation is not right now. It will be as for your convenience, and AI experts will get in touch with you, you know, to take a convenience time and date when you would be available for that one-hour consultation, and accordingly you can arrange it with them.  So is it okay if I go ahead and register your interest for this one-hour consultation?
 SPEAKER_02: Not at the present, sir. Like I say, I'm going to hold off on time being, sir. You can contact me later, and right now I really don't have the time, okay?
 SPEAKER_01: Okay. All right, no worries.  Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.  Thank you so much for your time.  You're welcome.  Thank you, sir.  All right.

 SPEAKER_01: Okay, no, I don't want my contact information being spread around.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, just nobody about it. Well, I really appreciate your time. You have a good day. Bye bye.  Thanks. Bye bye.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hello.  Hello.  Hey, am I talking to Mark Maier at Express Technologies?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, you are.
 SPEAKER_00: Hi Mark, this is Sivy and I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services. How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: You're pretty good.
 SPEAKER_00: Mark, I believe you are the senior project manager over there. Is that correct?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes, you are.
 SPEAKER_00: The reason behind my call today, Mark, is that we have noticed your business has been using Amazon Web Services.  So we just wanted to share a limited time offer to help you leverage Generative AI to enhance your day-to-day business process.  So have you ever given it a thought of implementing Generative AI to your day-to-day business?
 SPEAKER_01: We have a CIO that handles all that kind of stuff.  So I try to, you know, whatever classes he sets up, I go to you, but I stay out of all that. That's on him.
 SPEAKER_00: Sorry?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, the answer is no, man. Some of the else handles all of our implementation and getting into training with that stuff.  So I don't want to... I don't say you have to do something that's out of my wheelhouse.
 SPEAKER_00: So Mark, if you're interested in learning, just learning how Generative AI can enhance your day-to-day process,  we are actually offering this limited time one hour free consultation with an AI expert and you don't have to make any decision whatsoever.  You can just, you know, schedule that consultation according to your availability, obviously, and your preference.  And you can get all the information about how Generative AI can help you leverage a lot of enhancement in your day-to-day business operation.  So would it be okay if, tonight, go ahead and schedule that consultation for you? You don't have to rush on scheduling it.  You can schedule it according to your availability, not this week, not another, you know, whenever you're free.  So would it be okay?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I'm not even sorry. I'm just going to say no to that. To get my company's looking into it, and I don't want to be, you know,  giving my toes into too many different pools here, though, but I appreciate what you're doing.  I think you guys have a good market. I think AI is going to do a lot for this industry.  I just don't think it's right for us right now. So thank you for your call, man. I appreciate it.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello.
 SPEAKER_01: Hello.  Can I ask you to start?  Is this the Zach Young.
 SPEAKER_00: What's up?
 SPEAKER_01: Zach, my name is Alton.  I'm calling you on behalf of AWS.  Amazon web services, how are you?
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, what do you need?
 SPEAKER_01: Is that the reason of my call is I believe you spoke to one of my colleagues last week regarding sending you an email based on generative AI.  Now, when we are trying to send it to your email address, it's showing as a bounce back.  So I'm just calling to check just to confirm your correct email address.  Would that be okay?
 SPEAKER_00: What is this for?
 SPEAKER_01: As I said, I'm calling you from on behalf of AWS, Amazon Web Services.  Sure.  So, can you...  Go ahead.
 SPEAKER_00: I don't think I do anything with AWS.
 SPEAKER_01: No, it's not you.  It's your business that's used some part of our services.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, which business?
 SPEAKER_01: Young nationalities, young trucks.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, not clear where you're getting this information.  And how are we using AWS?
 SPEAKER_01: So, I mean, like it could be AWS can be used to build your website, starting from building your website to, you know, do storage of your customer data, cloud storage, application development, a lot of things we do.  So I'm not sure which part of that product you are using right now, but we know, I mean, like we have analyzed that you are using some part of it.
 SPEAKER_00: Well, if you can't tell me anything more detailed than that, I don't know what you're doing to help me.  I don't need anything.
 SPEAKER_01: So, Zach, the reason I'm calling you because we noticed that, as I said, you know, we are promoting Generative AI, you know, Gen AI, which is artificial intelligence.  Businesses like yours who are into transport and truck businesses have leveraged Generative AI and they have improved their day-to-day operational efficiency.  So that is the reason we are calling.  So if we are promoting a one-hour free consultation with one of our, an AI expert who can help you to know more about Generative AI and how you can leverage Generative AI into your day-to-day operations.  So that's the reason I'm calling.  So we spoke last week regarding this with one of my colleagues and you agreed to send you in detail and enroll you for a one-hour free consultation.
 SPEAKER_00: So, but I don't really remember that happening.  I don't know.  I'm not interested in this.  Okay.

 SPEAKER_01: Hi, Stephen.  My name is Alton.  I'm calling you on behalf of AWS.  Amazon Web Services.  How are you?  I'm okay.  How are you?  I'm doing fine, Stephen.  Thank you for asking.  Stephen, the reason of my call is we noticed that your business has been using IAWS for quite a long time.  And we just wanted to check during this course of time, I mean, like in the last couple of years,  have you ever thought of implementing Generative AI to your business?  Artificial intelligence?
 SPEAKER_02: No, and we're not interested in making any changes to our cloud stack at this time.
 SPEAKER_01: No, we are not asking you to make any changes to your cloud.  Generative AI is a separate league altogether.  I mean, it is basically used to enhance your day-to-day operations and, you know,  optimize different segments of your business like sales and marketing.  And as I see that your company is more into your company's switchback, right?  Switchback, let's see.
 SPEAKER_02: We're not looking to use any sort of Generative AI product at this time.  Thanks anyway.  Okay, Stephen, thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: Hey Robert, this is Phoebe and I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services. How are you?  I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  I believe you are the manager at Kelly, Max Kelly Oil Field Services. Is that correct?
 SPEAKER_00: Yes.
 SPEAKER_01: So Robert, the reason behind my call today is that we have noticed your business has been using AWS services.  So I just wanted to share a limited time complimentary opportunity that we have with us  on leveraging Generative AI to grow your day-to-day business operations efficiency.  So like have you ever given it a thought of implementing Generative AI to your day-to-day business?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, but I'm not interested in that right now.
 SPEAKER_01: That's okay Robert, that's totally understandable if you're not interested.  For feedback purpose, can I know the reason why you're not interested right now?
 SPEAKER_00: No, that'll be off.
 SPEAKER_01: So Robert, basically if you're thinking this is a sales call or you have to avail some services or whatever, this is not.  It is just going to be an R-free consultation with an AI expert that also you can schedule according to your availability and preference.  So would that be okay for you, you know, for starters?
 SPEAKER_00: No, I'm not interested.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you.

 SPEAKER_01: This is Jason.
 SPEAKER_00: Hi, good afternoon, Jason.  This is Pranel.  How are you doing today?  Good.  How about you?  I'm fine.  Thank you so much for asking, Jason.  Actually, Jason, I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web Services.  And like reason for my call is that you are the regional sales director at MES Solutions,  right?  That is correct.  Perfect.  So, Jason, actually we have noticed that your business have been using AWS services and  we are here to offer a free one-hour consultation with our AI experts and they will help you  to leverage cutting edge AI technology to grow your business and ease down your business  operations.  So, Jason, I just wanted to know like have you ever thought about implementing a generative  AI into your day-to-day business operations like for making a sales strategies and different  different type of what we say generating leads and everything?  Have you ever thought about it, Jason?
 SPEAKER_01: No.  No.  In fact, just to, and I don't mean to cut you off or anything like that, but as far as  the implementation and whatnot of bringing AI in, that's not my department.  That would be, that's going to be done at our corporate level, which will be out of  our, you know, somewhere in Boston office or Atlanta.  So, I would not be the person to speak with.
 SPEAKER_00: Actually, Jason, the thing is that we are not here to, like we are not asking you for  making any type of decisions.  The thing is that just wanted to schedule a free one-hour consultation for you with our  AI expert.  You can attend the consultation, like you can schedule it according to your availability.  You can have a word with our AI expert and they can explain you how to implement generative  AI into your day-to-day business operations.  So, just have a look at it.  You can have a word with them according to your availability.  So, is it okay if I just go ahead and schedule, like, interest for you?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I can't.  I don't think you understand.  I cannot do that.  Okay.  I do not have the authority to have a meeting to implement AI into our systems or security.  That would have to come through our corporate department and IT.  I literally cannot do anything like that.
 SPEAKER_00: I'm extremely sorry, like, but the thing is that I'm not asking you to implement any system  into your own business.
 SPEAKER_01: I know, but I cannot.  Like, right now, I've got a firewall.  If I tried to bring an AI or I'm talking about utilizing that, it will block me from doing  that in our VDI.  So, literally, there's nothing that I could do.  Like, you're asking me basically saying, hey, Jason, just give me an hour of your time  for something that you cannot do.  That's what I'm trying to say, is that, like, literally, it would be no benefit to me without  approval from them.  I could not utilize it.  So, I'm sorry to say it that way, but yeah, I don't want to be rude, but I'm like, I would  love to have AI help me on some stuff.  I really would, but I don't have that authority to do that.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, okay.  Got it.  Yeah, I got your point, Jason.  No worries.  That's fine.  Thank you so much for helping.  All right.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you.  Have a good day. Unknown Speaker: 
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah.  Same to you.  Happy weekend.  Take care.
 SPEAKER_01: Thank you.

 SPEAKER_00: Hello?  My name is Grace.  Yep, can you hear me?  Yes.  Good afternoon.  My name is Grace and then I'm calling on behalf of Amazon Wait Services.  How are you?
 SPEAKER_01: Good, thanks.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, could you hear that?  So actually the reason I call you today is that you are the vice president with double  day distribution, right?
 SPEAKER_01: Uh-huh.
 SPEAKER_00: Uh-huh.  So that is why I'm calling you today because we have noticed your business has been using  AWS services.  And Mr. Jorbe, I just wanted to understand here, have you ever thought of implementing  generative AI or have you ever tried using gen AI in your day-to-day business?
 SPEAKER_01: Is that a service that Amazon provides? Unknown Speaker: Yep.
 SPEAKER_01: Uh, nope, not familiar with it.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, so that is the reason I'm calling you today because we are offering a free one-hour  discussion or consultation with AI experts on how you can, I mean, sorry, how it can  help improve operational efficiency and speed to market because we have seen many businesses  with significant benefits from implementing AI solutions.  So would you like me to go ahead and schedule you for this consultation?  That will be totally up to your convenience time.
 SPEAKER_01: No, I don't think I'm interested.
 SPEAKER_00: May I ask why?
 SPEAKER_01: I just don't know, like it's something that we are interested in utilizing at this time.
 SPEAKER_00: Can I, I mean, I just wanted to let you know that I'm not asking you to make any changes  right away or I'm not asking you to make any decisions and the consultation is not today  or tomorrow.  It will happen according to your convenience time.  You can schedule it according to your convenience time.  There is no obligation.  That's it.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I mean, I'm utilizing some other AI at the moment and so I'm kind of happy with  what we are doing.  And so I think in the moment we're happy with that.  We can research into this Amazon service just kind of on our own and then set that up if  we feel like that's something that applies to us.
 SPEAKER_00: So would you like to know more about it through this consultation or discussion?
 SPEAKER_01: Not at the moment.  Yeah, maybe in a few months when we have a little bit more time to do that, but not  right now.  We're just a little busy with what we currently have going on and so maybe a little bit later  on.
 SPEAKER_00: So as I said, the free consultation is not today, tomorrow or next week.  You can schedule it according to your convenience time.  Let's talk to them to you.  I mean, if you're interested.  If you're still interested.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  In that case, can we, can you call back in a couple months when things are a little bit  slower for us?
 SPEAKER_00: Sure.  No problem.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay.  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: All right.  Have a good day.  Bye-bye.
 SPEAKER_01: Bye.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out. Unknown Speaker: Hello?
 SPEAKER_00: Hey, am I talking to Shane Shelton at Milestone Equipment Holding?
 SPEAKER_01: Yes ma'am.
 SPEAKER_00: Hey Shane, this is Phoebe and I'm here to talk to you about the  reason behind my call today Shane is that we have noticed your business has been using  AWS services and I had a limited time offer on leveraging generative AI to grow your business.  So like have you ever given it a thought of implementing generative AI to your day to day  business process?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't think we don't do much of that and we're a trading company.  We don't have much use for that I don't think.  I appreciate you calling me though.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, that's very understandable Shane.  Although if you are interested in just learning, this call was not a sales call.  I'm not trying to tell you anything.  If you're just interested in learning how generative AI can impact your day to day  process and bring in the changes, we are actually providing one hour free consultation with an  AI expert that you can schedule according to your availability and preference.  So would it be okay for you to schedule that?  You don't have to make any decision on the consultation for that.
 SPEAKER_01: That will probably have to be done through my IT department.  I don't think I would be able to do that.  So let me give it to them and see.  Can I just call you back on this number?
 SPEAKER_00: Yeah, you can.  For right now, can I, if you're not interested in the consultation, it is not a big,  big deal Shane.  It is just going to be a consultation and we are going to start with you.  And if you like, if you find it relevant, then only you can move forward.  As I told you, there's no obligation about making decisions.
 SPEAKER_01: Okay, thanks.

 SPEAKER_01: Good afternoon, Dean.  Hello.  Good afternoon, Dean.  This is Pranav.  How are you doing today?  I'm doing okay.  I'm going to help you.  I'm fine.  Actually, Dean, the thing is that I'm calling you on behalf  of Amazon Web Services.  And the thing is that you are the division director for IT  and World Banking at Modgage World Bankers, right?  Yes.  So, Dean, that is the reason.  We have noticed that your business has been using AWS  services and we are offering a free migration  and licensing optimization assessment that has helped many  businesses like yours to reduce their total cost  of ownership by up to 56% and migrate 34% faster to AWS Cloud.  So, Dean, just wanted to know, like, would you be interested  in taking this assessment through, like, from the partner  of AWS, like TD Cinex?  No, thank you.  May I know the reason just for the feedback purpose?  Oh, because we deal with FISERF on a different  higher level and they take care of all of that for us now.  Actually, the thing is that you don't have to, like, change  any services or anything.  It is just a part of offer.  And also, you will receive $300 of AWS credits and also  in-depth analysis of your IT assets and complementary AWS  Cloud readiness assessment.  And it can also help you to save your IT cost and everything.  So, like, you can just take this assessment and you can have  a word with our experts also.  OK, but I just found we're good.  Thank you.  OK, no worries.  Thank you.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hi, good afternoon.  I'm speaking with Marty.  Yes, sir.  Marty, hi.  My name is Alton.  I'm calling you on behalf of AWS.  We spoke yesterday.  You asked me to call up today.  You were busy?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, I don't think I asked you to call today.  I just mentioned that I was tied up in something yesterday.  We have a lot of people who are not in the office.  I can give you just a minute.
 SPEAKER_00: Marty, the reason I'm calling you because we see that your business has been using AWS  for quite a long time now.  Not really.
 SPEAKER_01: No, we haven't.  We established an AWS account.  We've never really done anything with it.
 SPEAKER_00: Right, but you have established the account.  We have the association and the reason I'm calling you because right now we are implementing  or we are helping organizations like yours to implement it generative AI solutions.
 SPEAKER_01: Generative AI solutions.  Yeah.  Okay.  What would we do with the generative AI solution?
 SPEAKER_00: We can do a lot of things.  I can help you understand how it will be beneficial as per your company's needs.  So as I see that you're currently working as director IT at Asia's Chemical, right?  Yes, that's correct.  So with generative AI you can do process optimization, predictive maintenance, supply chain management, quality control,  chemical research and development, regulatory compliance, customer support and sales,  safety and hazard management, data driven decision making, environmental impact analysis.  So these are some of, like, you know, out of thousands of what you can do.  I've just given you a few examples.  Right now I'm not looking for your commitment.  All what we are doing here is we are trying to schedule a one hour consultation.  It's a free consultation with our AI expert who will help you to understand how you can leverage generative AI  into your day to day operations and business.  And it's not has to be today, tomorrow or sometimes this next week.  It can be scheduled as per your availability.  So would that be okay if I go ahead and...
 SPEAKER_01: No, this is not a good time for me.  I was just a little more curious about what you were proposing.
 SPEAKER_00: No, we are not doing...  We are not asking.
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, you can try me back another time.  At the moment I'm pretty wrapped up in something.
 SPEAKER_00: No, we are not asking you to take the concentration right now.  That's what I said.  All I'm going to take your interest, if you're interested, I can register your interest  and one of our colleagues will call you or one of our partners will call you maybe in a couple of weeks.  And then they will go ahead and schedule it as per your time and availability.  So that's what I'm trying to do here today.  I'm just collecting the interest of someone who is interested to know more about generative AI.
 SPEAKER_01: Gotcha.  So again, thanks for calling, but right now I'm not interested.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, Marti, no problem.  Thank you.  Thank you. Unknown Speaker: Thank you.

Transcript: SPEAKER_00: We are dialing out.  Hello, Michael Kraus speaking.
 SPEAKER_01: Hi, good afternoon, Michael.  This is Fernando.  How are you doing today?
 SPEAKER_00: I'm good.  How are you doing?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm fine.  Thank you so much for asking, Michael.  Actually, Michael, I'm calling you on behalf of Amazon Web  Services, AWS.  And reason for my call is that you are the vice president  at Agro America, right?
 SPEAKER_00: Correct.
 SPEAKER_01: Perfect.  So, Michael, we also have noticed that your business has  been using AWS.  And we wanted to share a free consultation offer with you.  And it will help you to leverage cutting edge AI  technology to grow your business and ease down your  business operations.  So, Michael, just wanted to know, like, have you ever  thought about implementing generative AI into your  day-to-day business operations?
 SPEAKER_00: No, but I'll be honest.  I'm not the right person for that.  You probably want to talk to the person that is in charge of  our IT group.  His name is Leo Aguilera.  Let me see.  I know he's in the main office.  But if you call the main office, I would reach out and try  and get ahold of him.  He's probably the best one to speak to.
 SPEAKER_01: But the thing is that, Michael, it is not related to any  technology part of the business.  The thing is that, as you are the vice president, it is  related to the operations part, like implementing generative  AI into your day-to-day business life, where you can  ease down your workload.  The thing is that our AI experts will reach out to you.  They will help you to understand your current use case and  the business course, explore industry-specific AI  applications, and they will develop a custom AI model to  tailor it according to your needs.  So we are not asking you to take any type of decisions right  now.  We just wanted to help you.  You can attend the consultation according to your  availability with our AI experts.  They will help you to ease down your business processes.  So is it OK if I just register your interest for this?  They will get back to you.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you, Brian.  I'm not interested in this time.  Have a great day.
 SPEAKER_01: OK, Michael Lovers.  Thank you so much.  Thank you.

So like have you ever given it a thought of implementing generative AI to your day to day business?
 SPEAKER_01: No, we are not going to do anything this year. So if you are going to call us back in one year then we will try.
 SPEAKER_02: Yes, that's okay Serigai. This call was not to sell you something or whatsoever.  Basically if you are interested in just learning how generative AI can impact your business.
 SPEAKER_01: No, but I already mentioned that call in one year and then we will talk.
 SPEAKER_02: Okay, so in the meantime can I send you an email?
 SPEAKER_01: You can send me an email.
 SPEAKER_02: Okay, so your full name is Serigai Souchenka and can you provide me with your email?

 SPEAKER_01: I don't recognize the number. Unknown Speaker: Hi.
 SPEAKER_00: My name is Grace and then I'm calling you on behalf of AWS, Amazon Web Services.  And actually the reason I call is that you are the president with FlightOne software, correct?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah. Unknown Speaker: Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: So that is the reason Amazon Web Services would like to discuss an exciting opportunity  with you for small and medium businesses like yours to explore generative AI solutions.  And we have noticed your business has been using AWS services.  So Steve, I wanted to understand here, have you ever thought of implementing generative AI  or have you ever tried using generative AI for your day-to-day business?
 SPEAKER_01: No, that doesn't apply.  It's just a small business and that really doesn't apply to what we do.  But thank you anyway, all right?
 SPEAKER_00: Steve, can I also let you know that I'm not asking you to implement it or I'm not asking you to make any changes.  I'm calling because we are offering a free discussion or consultation which can help you improve operational efficiency and speed to market  because we have also seen many businesses with significant benefits from implementing AI solutions.  So would you like to learn more about it through this one-hour discussion with our AI?
 SPEAKER_01: No, I wouldn't be interested.  And I wouldn't be interested.  Right now AI doesn't apply anywhere to my business and it's just a small operation, small business anyway.  And just so basically, you know, I've already implemented all the systems I need to at this point, you know, so.  But anyway, I do need to run but I do appreciate it, okay?  Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay, then.
 SPEAKER_01: All right, thank you.  Have a good day.  Bye.  You too.  Thank you.  Okay, bye.

Transcript: SPEAKER_01: We are dialing out.  Hello, this is Eric.
 SPEAKER_00: Hi, Eric.  This is Omar.  You're speaking with, I'm calling you today on behalf of 8 of US as the Amazon Web Services.  How are you doing?
 SPEAKER_01: Hi, how are you?
 SPEAKER_00: I'm also doing good.  Thank you for asking.  How are you, sir?
 SPEAKER_01: I'm okay.
 SPEAKER_00: Thank you. Unknown Speaker: Thank you.
 SPEAKER_00: Very good to hear that.  So, Eric, the reason of my call that if I'm not mistaken, you are the director of IT, right?
 SPEAKER_01: That's correct. Unknown Speaker: That's great.
 SPEAKER_00: Great.  So, the reason behind my call today, Eric, that we have noticed that your business has  been using AWS services.  And, you know, we just wanted to share a limited time offer to help you leverage the  generative AI.  Now, with that being said, Eric, we are not offering you any services.  So, Eric, as you're being the IT director, have you ever thought of implementing JNAI services  to your day-to-day activities to increase efficiency by an interest?
 SPEAKER_01: Yeah, a little bit.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  That's really great.  So, Eric, that's the main purpose of my call to you, to offer you one hour free consultation  with our AI experts.  If you are really interested in how generative AI can help you, you know, ease out your operations,  like increasing the resource management, marketing sites, all of that.  So, we are offering one hour free consultation today with our AI experts.  It is totally complementary with AWS so you can get all the insights and perspective.  And, best part is you don't have to make any decisions or whatsoever.  You can just avail the consultation and see how it goes to help your business, and that's it.  So, if you are really up to it, I will resist you for the same, and I will share all the details  in one single email.  How does that sound?
 SPEAKER_01: It sounds great, but I'm not really interested.  But thank you.  Appreciate you for reaching out.  Thanks a lot.
 SPEAKER_00: Bye-bye.  But, Eric, the best part, like I said, you can consult this consultation according to your  feasibility, according to your time and convenience.
 SPEAKER_01: So, our footprint in AWS is quite small, and it's probably not something we'll be continuing  to use in the future.  So, but I appreciate it again.  Okay.
 SPEAKER_00: Okay.  Okay, no worries, Eric, but thank you for your time.  Don't thank you for letting me know all of this.  Yeah, have a good day.  Thank you.  Bye-bye.  You have a blessed day.  Thank you. Unknown Speaker: Thank you.
